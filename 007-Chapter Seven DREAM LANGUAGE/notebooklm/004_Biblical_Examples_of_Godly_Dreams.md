# Biblical Examples of Godly Dreams

The source provides several **Biblical examples of Godly dreams**, noting that God speaks to His prophets through dreams, and also to others for His purposes. These examples include:

*   **Abraham**: God spoke to Abraham in a dream regarding the future of his descendants. Specifically, the dream revealed that his descendants would endure centuries of slavery in Egypt, but would eventually be delivered and settled in the Promised Land. This dream occurred during the cutting of the covenant between Abraham and God. The source also notes that Abraham is referred to as a prophet in Genesis 20:7.

*   **Jacob**: God communicated with Jacob, Abraham's grandson, through dreams. In one notable dream, Jacob saw a ladder extending into Heaven with angels ascending and descending. The Lord stood at the top of the ladder and promised to be with Jacob, to prosper him, to make his descendants into a great nation, and to give them their own land. This dream reiterated the promise that God had previously made to Abraham. The source also states that this passage in Genesis 28 gives an understanding of "open heavens". Jacob is also identified as a prophet in Psalm 105:15.

*   **Daniel**: Daniel, an Old Testament prophet, received dreams from the Lord. One significant dream was about four great and fearsome creatures, which symbolized earthly kingdoms and their eventual defeat by the Son of Man. The source notes that Daniel was a very visionary prophet.

*   The source also provides examples of **God using dreams to speak to non-believers**:
    *   **Abimelech**: God warned Abimelech in a dream that Sarah, whom he had taken into his harem, was Abraham's wife and that he would die if he did not return her.
    *   **Laban**: God warned Laban in a dream not to harm Jacob after Jacob fled with his family.
    *   **A Midianite soldier**: God gave a Midianite soldier a dream of a loaf of barley bread destroying his camp, which was then interpreted by another soldier as a sign of Gideon's victory.
    *  **Pharaoh's butler and baker**: Joseph interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh's butler and baker while in prison, foretelling their respective fates.
    *   **Pharaoh**: God gave Pharaoh a dream about seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine. Joseph was able to interpret the dream.
    *   **Nebuchadnezzar**: God gave Nebuchadnezzar a profound dream that only Daniel could interpret.
    *   **The wise men**: God warned the wise men in a dream not to return to Herod after they visited the newborn Christ.
    *   **Pilate's wife**: Pilate's wife warned him in a dream not to harm Jesus.

    *  **Joseph, son of Jacob**: Had a dream symbolizing his future rule over his brothers, which eventually came true.
     *   **King Solomon**: God appeared to Solomon in a dream, offering him anything he wished. Solomon asked for wisdom to rule his people well.
     *   **Joseph, the earthly father of Jesus**: Received three dreams related to the birth and early life of Jesus, including being told to not fear taking Mary as his wife, to flee to Egypt, and later to return to Israel.
