# Wisdom Points to Remember\n\n**Other Godly People Receiving Dreams**

The source provides some "wisdom points to remember" regarding dreams and visions, in addition to examples of godly people who were not prophets receiving dreams. Here's a summary of those points:

*   **Dreams and visions originate from three sources**:
    *   The demonic realm.
    *   The soulish realm, meaning one's own human mind and spirit.
    *   The Holy Spirit.
    It's important to discern the source of any visionary revelation in order to effectively give or receive it.

*   **Environment matters**:
    *   It is important to remove objects that may be associated with cults, the occult, or even soulish ties before sleeping, to create an environment that is ready to receive pure revelation.
    *   It is important to identify and close off all potential demonic entrances to one's home.
    *   Certain objects, such as dolls, may be used for witchcraft or other demonic purposes, requiring discernment and prayer to determine if they are safe to keep or should be disposed of.

*   **A warning from Deuteronomy**:
    *   Deuteronomy 13:1-5 warns against listening to a prophet or dreamer who encourages following other gods, even if their signs or wonders come true.
    *   This passage emphasizes that God is testing people to see if they love Him with all their heart and soul.
    *   Those who attempt to seduce others away from God should be put to death.

*   **Focus on Jesus**:
    *   Dreams and visions are wonderful, but our lives are more than just dreams and visions. Our lives are in Jesus Christ.
    *   It is important to examine a seer's message, lifestyle, and conduct.
    *   If their message goes against the principles found in the written Word of God, they are deceived, immature or false prophets.
    *   **Dreams and visions must direct us to Jesus, as He is the ultimate goal**.
    *   By getting Jesus, we get God and the Author of all authentic dreams and visions.

The source also includes examples of **godly people who were not considered prophets** but still received dreams from God. These individuals include:
*   **Joseph, son of Jacob**: Joseph had a dream that symbolized his future rule over his brothers, which was fulfilled years later when his brothers bowed before him in Egypt. This dream is described in Genesis 37:5-11.
*   **King Solomon**: God appeared to Solomon in a dream offering to grant him anything he wished. Solomon asked for wisdom to rule his people, and God granted him not only wisdom but also great riches and honor. This dream is described in 1 Kings 3:5.
*   **Joseph, the earthly father of Jesus**: Joseph received three dreams related to Jesus's birth and early life.
    *   The first dream revealed that he should not fear taking Mary as his wife because the child she carried was of the Holy Spirit. This is described in Matthew 1:20.
    *   The second dream was a warning to take Mary and Jesus to Egypt to escape Herod. This dream is in Matthew 2:13.
    *   The third dream instructed Joseph to return to Israel with his family after Herod’s death. This dream is in Matthew 2:19-20.

These examples show that **dreams are not exclusive to prophets** and that God uses them to communicate with a variety of people for different purposes.
