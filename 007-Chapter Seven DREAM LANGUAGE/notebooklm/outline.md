Okay, here is an outline of the key concepts from the document "007-Chapter Seven DREAM LANGUAGE.md," using the headings found in the source:

**### DREAM LANGUAGE**

*   **Introduction**: The Holy Spirit uses dreams, visions, and trances as avenues for visionary revelation.
*   **Dreams vs. Visions**: Dreams occur during sleep, while visions usually occur when one is awake. Both have biblical precedent as ways God speaks to prophets.
*   **Biblical Basis**:  God speaks through dreams and visions to prophets. Numbers 12:6 is cited as evidence that God uses these methods to speak to His prophets. However, the ability to receive dreams is not limited to prophets; Joel 2:28 indicates that God will pour out His Spirit on all mankind, so that both young and old will have visions and dreams. It is time for the Church to understand dreams biblically as a way to discern God's voice.
*   **Biblical Examples of Godly Dreams**:
    *   **Abraham**: God spoke to Abraham in a dream about his descendants' slavery in Egypt and their eventual deliverance. Abraham is also called a prophet in Genesis 20:7.
    *   **Jacob**: Jacob dreamed of a ladder to Heaven with angels, and God reiterated his promises to Abraham through this dream. This passage also gives insight into the concept of "open heavens".
    *   **Daniel**: Daniel had a dream of four creatures that represented earthly kingdoms. Daniel was a very visionary prophet.
*   **God Speaking to Heathens through Dreams**: God has used dreams to speak to non-believers in order to protect His people and bring glory to His name. Examples include:
    *   **Abimelech**: God warned Abimelech in a dream not to take Abraham's wife, Sarah.
    *   **Laban**: God warned Laban in a dream not to harm Jacob.
    *   **A Midianite soldier**: God gave a Midianite soldier a dream of a loaf of bread destroying his camp, which his friend then interpreted as a sign of Gideon's victory.
    *   **Pharaoh's butler and baker**: Joseph interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh's butler and baker while in prison.
    *   **Pharaoh**: God gave Pharaoh a dream of seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine, which Joseph interpreted.
    *   **Nebuchadnezzar**: God gave Nebuchadnezzar a dream that only Daniel could interpret.
    *   **The wise men**: God warned the wise men in a dream not to return to Herod.
    *    **Pilate's wife**: Pilate's wife warned him in a dream not to harm Jesus.
*   **Other Godly People Receiving Dreams**: The Bible also tells of non-prophets who received dreams from God.
    *   **Joseph, son of Jacob**: Had a dream that symbolized his future ruling over his brothers.
    *   **King Solomon**: God appeared to Solomon in a dream and told him to ask for whatever he wanted; Solomon asked for wisdom.
    *   **Joseph, the earthly father of Jesus**: Received three dreams concerning the birth and early life of Jesus.

**The Symbolic Language of Dreams**

*   **Dreams and Symbolism**: Dreams are the language of emotions and often contain symbolism.
*  **Consistency of God's Symbolic Language**: God is consistent in His use of symbols throughout the Bible. The way He speaks in Genesis is similar to the way He speaks in Revelation. This consistency also applies to our own lives.

    *   **Symbolic colors**
    *  **Symbolic creatures**
    *   **Symbolic directions**

    *  **Amber**: The glory or presence of God
    *   **Black**: Sin, death, or famine
    *   **Blue**: Heaven or the Holy Spirit; also interpreted as the promises of God and/or the prophetic activity of the Holy Spirit

    *   **Purple**: Kingship; royalty
    *   **Red**: Bloodshed; war
    *  **White**: Purity, light, righteousness
    *   **Green**: Life; the Levites; intercession
*   **The Interpretation and Meaning of Symbolic Numbers**: Numbers in the Bible are highly symbolic, and careful interpretation is needed
    *   **Principles for interpreting numbers**:
        *   Simple numbers 1-13 often have spiritual significance.
        *   Multiples of these numbers carry the same meaning, but are intensified.
        *   The first use of a number in the Scriptures generally conveys its spiritual meaning.
        *  Numbers should be interpreted consistently throughout the Scriptures.
        *   The spiritual significance may not always be stated, but may be veiled.
        *   There are often good and evil, true and counterfeit, and godly and satanic aspects to numbers.
    *   **Symbolic meaning of individual numbers**:
        *   **One**: God, beginning, source
        *   **Two**: Witness, testimony
        *  **Three**: Godhead, divine completeness
        *   **Four**: The earth, Creation, winds, seasons
        *   **Five**: Cross, grace, atonement
        *   **Six**: Humanity, beast, satan
        *   **Seven**: Perfection, completeness

        *   **Twelve**: Divine government, apostolic fullness
        *   **Thirteen**: Rebellion, backsliding, apostasy

**Wisdom Points to Remember**

*   **Source of Dreams**: Dreams and visions can come from the demonic realm, the soulish realm, or the Holy Spirit. Discernment is needed to identify the source.
*   **Environment**: The environment can affect the purity of revelation; it may be necessary to remove certain objects that could invite demonic activity.
*   **Precautionary Warning**: Deuteronomy 13:1-5 warns against following prophets or dreamers who lead people away from God.
*   **Focus on Jesus**:  Our lives are in Jesus; dreams and visions should point us to Him. Examine the messages, conduct and actions of those who give prophetic revelation. Do their messages align with the written Word of God?.
*   **The Goal**: The goal is Jesus, and He is the source of authentic dreams and visions.
