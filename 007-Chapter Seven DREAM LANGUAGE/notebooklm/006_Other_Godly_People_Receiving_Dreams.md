# Other Godly People Receiving Dreams

The source provides examples of godly people, who were not necessarily considered prophets, receiving dreams from God. These individuals include:

*   **Joseph, son of Jacob**: Joseph had a dream that symbolized his future rule over his brothers, which was fulfilled years later when his brothers bowed before him in Egypt. This dream is described in Genesis 37:5-11.
*   **King Solomon**: God appeared to Solomon in a dream offering to grant him anything he wished. Solomon asked for wisdom to rule his people, and God granted him not only wisdom but also great riches and honor. This dream is described in 1 Kings 3:5.
*   **Joseph, the earthly father of Jesus**: Joseph received **three dreams** related to Jesus's birth and early life.
    *   The first dream revealed that he should not fear taking Mary as his wife because the child she carried was of the Holy Spirit. This is described in Matthew 1:20.
    *   The second dream was a warning to take Mary and Jesus to Egypt to escape Herod. This dream is in Matthew 2:13.
    *  The third dream instructed Joseph to return to Israel with his family after Herod’s death. This dream is in Matthew 2:19-20.

These examples demonstrate that **dreams are not exclusive to prophets** and that God uses them to communicate with a variety of people for different purposes.
