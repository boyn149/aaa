# Symbolic Creatures

The source explains that **symbolic creatures** are used in prophetic dreams and visions to represent specific concepts or entities. Here are the examples provided in the source:

*   **The dragon and the serpent** are used to represent **Satan**. The source cites Revelation 12:9: "And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him". This verse clearly identifies the dragon and serpent as symbols of the devil.

*  **Frogs** are used to symbolize **unclean spirits or demons**. The source references Revelation 16:13-14a: "And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs; for they are spirits of demons". This verse links frogs to demonic entities, indicating their symbolic meaning in dreams and visions.

The source uses these examples to illustrate how creatures can be used as symbolic representations in the visionary realm, emphasizing that understanding these symbols can help interpret the messages of prophetic dreams.
