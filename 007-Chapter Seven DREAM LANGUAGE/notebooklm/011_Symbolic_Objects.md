# Symbolic Objects

The source explains that **symbolic objects** are used in prophetic dreams and visions to represent specific concepts or ideas. Here are the symbolic objects discussed in the source:

*   **Rock:** A rock can symbolize **Peter** or perhaps **Jesus**. The source references Matthew 16:18: “you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church." Additionally, the source notes that a rock as a symbol for the Lord is common in the Bible, citing Psalm 18:2 and 1 Corinthians 10:4 as examples.
*   **Gate:** A gate can symbolize the **entrance to the realm of darkness**. The source refers to the same verse, Matthew 16:18: "and the gates of Hades will not overpower it," to illustrate this symbolism.
*   The source also mentions that many other **common objects** are used symbolically in the Bible, such as shields, bowls, harps, and candlesticks.

The source emphasizes that understanding the symbolic meaning of objects can provide deeper insight into the messages of prophetic dreams and visions.
