# Symbolic Directions

The source explains that **symbolic directions** are used in prophetic dreams and visions to convey spiritual meanings. Here's how the source describes the symbolism of directions:

*   **Up** often symbolizes **moving toward God or toward righteousness**.
*   **Down** often symbolizes **moving away from God or toward unrighteousness**.

The source provides the following biblical examples to illustrate these symbolic directions:

*   **Luke 10:15**: "And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will be brought down to Hades". In this verse, being "exalted to heaven" is contrasted with being "brought down to Hades", which highlights the symbolic contrast between up and down.
*  **Genesis 12:10**: Abram went **down** to Egypt to escape a famine, which was **away from the land where God had directed him**.
*   **Genesis 13:1**: Abram went **up** from Egypt, **returning to his home**. This example illustrates "going up" as a return to a place of God's blessing.

These examples demonstrate that the direction in a dream can have symbolic meaning, with **upward movement often signifying a positive spiritual direction** and **downward movement signifying a negative spiritual direction**.
