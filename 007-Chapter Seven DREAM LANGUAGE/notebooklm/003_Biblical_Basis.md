# Biblical Basis

The source uses specific Bible verses to establish the biblical basis for dreams and visions as avenues of divine communication.

*   **Numbers 12:6** is the primary verse cited to show that God uses both dreams and visions to speak to prophets. The verse states: “If there is a prophet among you, I, the Lord, shall make Myself known to him in a vision. I shall speak with him in a dream”. This indicates that God uses both of these methods to communicate with His prophets.

*   The source also references **Joel 2:28**, which states: “It will come about after this that I will pour out My Spirit on all mankind; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions”. This verse is presented as evidence that the ability to receive dreams is not limited to prophets, but is available to all people through the Holy Spirit. It also suggests that dreams are a part of the prophetic ministry.
*   These verses together establish that **dreams and visions are not just random occurrences, but are divinely appointed ways for God to communicate with people, both prophets and others who are open to the Holy Spirit**.
