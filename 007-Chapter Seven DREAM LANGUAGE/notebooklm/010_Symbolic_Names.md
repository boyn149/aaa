# Symbolic Names

The source explains that **symbolic names** in the Bible often reflect the character of the individual. Here's how the source describes the symbolism of names:

*   **Names often reflect the character of the individual.** The source gives the example of Nabal, whose name literally means "dolt".
*   **Nabal's actions matched his name**, as he was foolish and inconsiderate toward David and his men. His wife, Abigail, even states, "as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name and folly is with him".
*   The source also shares a personal example of the author's middle name, **Wayne, meaning "wagon-builder or burden-bearer"**, noting that the author's father was a carpenter who worked with wagons, while the author is a "builder of a spiritual house" and a burden-bearer in prophetic intercession.

The source emphasizes that names carry weight in the spirit and their meaning is often more than just symbolic.
