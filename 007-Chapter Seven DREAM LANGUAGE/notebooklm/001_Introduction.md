# Introduction\n\n**The Holy Spirit uses dreams, visions, and trances as avenues for visionary revelation.**

The introduction to the document "007-Chapter Seven DREAM LANGUAGE.md" states that the **Holy Spirit uses three different avenues of visionary revelation to speak into our lives: dreams, visions, and trances**. The chapter focuses on dreams, and the two chapters that follow will further examine visions and trances. The primary difference between dreams and visions is that dreams occur during sleep while visions usually happen when one is fully awake or conscious. Both means of visual revelation have a solid biblical basis. Numbers 12:6 is quoted as evidence of God's use of dreams and visions to communicate with prophets. It states, “If there is a prophet among you, I, the Lord, shall make Myself known to him in a vision. I shall speak with him in a dream”.
