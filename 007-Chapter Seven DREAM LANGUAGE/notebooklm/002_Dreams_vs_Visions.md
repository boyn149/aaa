# Dreams vs. Visions

The source explains the difference between dreams and visions by stating that **dreams occur during sleep, while visions usually take place when one is fully awake or conscious**. Both are considered forms of visual revelation with a solid biblical precedent.

The source uses **Numbers 12:6** to support this distinction, quoting God as saying: “If there is a prophet among you, I, the Lord, shall make Myself known to him in a vision. I shall speak with him in a dream”. This verse indicates that both dreams and visions are avenues through which God communicates with prophets.

In summary:

*   **Dreams:** Occur during sleep.
*   **Visions:** Usually occur when one is awake and conscious.
*   **Biblical Basis**: Both are means of visual revelation supported by Numbers 12:6, indicating God uses both to speak with prophets.
