# God Speaking to Heathens through Dreams

The source provides several examples of God speaking to heathens, or non-believers, through dreams, emphasizing that **God's purpose in doing so is often to protect His people and bring glory to His name**.

Here are specific instances from the source:

*   **Abimelech:** This pagan king took Sarah, Abraham's wife, into his harem, believing she was Abraham's sister. God intervened in a dream, warning Abimelech that Sarah was married and that he would die if he did not return her. God told Abimelech, "Now therefore, restore the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live," and that he was kept from sinning against God. Abimelech complied, and all was well.
*   **Laban:** Jacob's father-in-law pursued him with the intent to harm him after Jacob fled with his family and flocks. God came to Laban in a dream, warning him not to speak to Jacob for good or evil. As a result, Laban met with Jacob peacefully.
*   **A Midianite Soldier:** God gave a dream to one Midianite soldier about a loaf of barley bread tumbling into the camp of Midian, which was interpreted by another soldier to mean the sword of Gideon. This dream encouraged Gideon to lead his band of 300 men to deliver the land from the Midianite invaders.
*   **Pharaoh's butler and baker:** While Joseph was in prison, he interpreted dreams for two non-believing Egyptians, the butler and the baker. These dreams foretold their respective fates, which came to pass three days later. These interpretations eventually led to Joseph's release and rise to power.
*    **Pharaoh:** God gave Pharaoh a dream predicting seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine. Joseph's interpretation of this dream led to his rise as second-in-command in Egypt and prepared the nation for the famine, which also served God's purpose of bringing Joseph's family to Egypt.
*   **Nebuchadnezzar:**  Nebuchadnezzar, one of the most evil rulers of the ancient world, received a profound dream from God, and only Daniel was able to interpret it. As a result of Daniel’s interpretation, Nebuchadnezzar recognized the power and glory of God.
*   **The wise men:** These magi from the east who came to worship the newborn Christ were warned in a dream not to return to Herod, protecting Jesus from Herod’s murderous jealousy.
*   **Pilate's wife:** During Jesus' trial, Pilate's wife sent him a warning she received in a dream, which stated that he should not harm Jesus, whom she called "that righteous Man”.

These examples show that **God uses dreams to communicate with individuals who do not know Him** for a variety of reasons, including to **protect His people and to accomplish His purposes**.
