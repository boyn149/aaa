# DISCERNING OF SPIRITS 

Exercising wisdom in judging revelatory activity is absolutely vital to the health and integrity of all ministry, whether of the everyday believer or a visionary prophet. Nowhere is this truer than in the area of the discerning of spirits. Unless we can consistently and reliably determine the source of the “revelation” and the nature of the spirit from which it comes, we run a high risk of deceiving ourselves and others. The proper use of this gift is important for multiple reasons, which we will investigate.

At the outset, let me clarify that we are talking about two overlapping but different issues here: general discernment, which is a product of experience, discipline, and study; and discerning of spirits, which is a spiritual gift imparted by the Holy Spirit. All of us as believers can grow in discernment by meditating regularly on the Word of God and by spending much time in the Lord’s presence. The more we mature in our faith and the more life experience we gain, the more our discernment will grow. We also learn by observing and gleaning from others, particularly people who are more mature and whose wisdom and judgment we respect.

Essentially, discernment is a wisdom issue. Discernment means having a place of perception in our lives—gained through meditation, study, and experience—that enables us to give wise counsel. It is this kind of discernment that Isaiah 11:2 describes as “the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.”

Discernment or distinguishing of spirits is different because it goes beyond our natural learning abilities. It is a supernatural gift from the Lord; we cannot earn it. No amount of human insight or learning will enable us to discern between spirits. Only God can impart that ability, and He does so by His sovereign choice. General discernment and the discerning of spirits are different, but related. One comes through disciplined study and holy living, while the other comes through direct, divine impartation. The principles for growing in both arenas are the same, however: regular meditation on the Word of God and the crucible of life experience.

Defining Discernment of Spirits
One of the best ways to begin understanding the whole arena of discerning of spirits is by turning to the words of experienced and godly servants of the Lord who have walked in this anointing for many years. The late Derek Prince once stated:

Discerning of spirits is the supernatural ability to recognize and distinguish between not only good and bad, but various classes of spirits:

The Holy Spirit
Good angels
Fallen angels
Demons or evil spirits
The human spirit
Discernment is a form of direct perception where knowledge is the impartation of fact.1

That last statement actually makes a distinction between discerning of spirits and receiving a word of knowledge. Discernment is a perception, a feeling, a sight-oriented thing, whereas a word of knowledge is a fact that is dropped into our thoughts or spirits.

John Wimber, the late Vineyard Ministries International leader, said:

Discerning of spirits is the supernatural capacity to judge whether the spirit operating has a source that is human, demonic, or divine. It is a supernatural perception in the spiritual realm for the purpose of determining the source of spiritual activity.2

Although this is an excellent definition, I personally believe that discerning of spirits goes beyond simply determining the source of the spiritual activity. That is only part of the picture. Discerning the source is the starting place, but there are other purposes as well.

According to apostolic leader Dick Iverson:

The gift of discerning spirits is the God given ability or enablement to recognize the identity (and very often the personality and condition) of the spirits which are behind different manifestations or activities. To “discern” means to perceive, distinguish, or differentiate. The dividing line between human and divine operation may be obscure to some believers, but one with the faculty of spiritual discernment sees a clear separation.3

Sometimes when dealing with the spiritual realm, we can find ourselves facing “gray” areas where things are unclear. That is one time when we need the gift of discerning of spirits to clear away the gray and separate matters into black and white.

The late Kenneth Hagin, father of the Word of Faith movement, expressed a similar idea:

The discerning of spirits gives insight into the spiritual world. It has to do with spirits, both good and bad. It is supernatural insight into the realm of spirits. To discern means to see—whether it be divine spirits, evil spirits, the human spirit or even the discerning of the similitude of God.4

Francis Frangipane, author and noted speaker on spiritual warfare, adds:

Spiritual discernment is the grace to see into the unseen. It is a gift of the Spirit to perceive what is in the spirit. Its purpose is to see into the nature of that which is veiled.5

Discernment and Our Five Senses
Discernment is a gift from God. This is true whether we are talking about general discernment between good and evil or discerning of spirits. Only in the rarest of cases does this gift come “full-blown” into a believer’s life. For most of us, discernment grows over time as we nurture it carefully from day to day. More often than not, discernment operates through our five senses and becomes strong in us through practice. Consider these words from the Book of Hebrews: “But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil” (Heb. 5:14).

Some things we learn by experience, and some we learn by watching others. We learn discernment by practice. When we submit ourselves to the lordship of Christ, He washes us clean from the defilement of the world, the flesh, and the demonic realm of the spirit. Our five natural senses—sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing—are free then to be trained in the discernment of good and evil. The more closely we walk with Christ and the more we submit our minds and wills to Him, the more acute our senses will become in discernment. It is a progressive unfolding.

One of the operative principles of the Kingdom of God that applies in every area of life is that our faithfulness in little things leads to being entrusted with greater things. As we prove faithful with what God has given us, He will give us more. For example, our faithfulness in managing natural mammon will lead to our being given rule over what Jesus called true spiritual riches. It is a simple principle: faithfulness in the natural will bring increase in the realm of the spirit.

The more we yield our natural five senses to the Lord, the more the anointing of God can come upon them, making us progressively more sensitive to His promptings. The more we learn to recognize and obey those promptings, the more promptings we will receive. As we prove ourselves faithful with a little, the Lord will entrust us with more.

Basically, discernment is perception, which can come in a variety of ways. Sometimes it is as simple as an inner knowledge, a “gut feeling,” that we cannot explain yet somehow know is real. This kind of spiritual perception is often so subtle that we can easily miss it or attribute it to something else, such as a “hunch.”

Seeing is another avenue of perception. As we have already observed, seeing can be internal, through images in the mind’s eye, or external, through an open vision. Sometimes it may be nothing more than a flash of light that brings a strong sense of a spiritual presence in the room, such as an angel. At other times, we may see an outline form or even a kind of fog of His glory filling the room. This again is a part of the “seer” package—divine perception. As our discernment grows, we may observe a kind of shimmering presence or, eventually, a fully defined vision, whether internal or external.

Sometimes spiritual discernment will come through our sense of smell. Many people have testified to sensing the presence of the Lord accompanied by the smell of roses. It is also possible at times to identify the enemy in the same way. A particular situation may not “smell right,” even if we don’t quite understand why. All we know is that it smells bad. There may be an actual unpleasant odor associated with the situation, such as the smell of sulfur. If there is no visible, apparent cause for the odor, it may be an indicator that an unclean spirit is present. Often, I have discerned addictions in a person’s life through this means. I actually “smell” a type of smoke that comes from a particular form of addiction—I then know in part how to proceed in ministering in that situation.

What about spiritual perception through the sense of taste? Have you ever heard someone say, “I don’t know for sure what’s going on, but this just leaves a bad taste in my mouth”? That phrase may be literal or figurative. In Ezekiel 3:3, the prophet, during a vision, eats a scroll that represents the Word of the Lord, and it is “sweet as honey” in his mouth. John records a similar experience in Revelation 10:9-10, where he eats a scroll containing God’s judgments on the nations. Although the scroll tastes as sweet as honey in John’s mouth, it makes his stomach bitter.

As far as the sense of touch is concerned, spiritual discernment may take the form of a tingling feeling, or even pain, particularly in situations where the Lord is revealing areas where He wants to release physical healing or deliverance. At times I receive physical pains in my heart, showing me wounding that has occurred in another’s life as a tool to “set the captives free.” This feeling arena can also be used to distinguish what spirit is in operation behind a certain activity.

Not long ago, at five o’clock one morning, my bedroom was ice-cold and I could feel this dark presence. I prayed in the Spirit and called on the blood of Jesus. I then fell back to sleep only to awaken from a dream from the Lord. In this dream, believers were proclaiming, “The Jezebel spirit has been bound!” The room was then filled with white light and a warm glowing feeling was now permeating the room. Victory had come, as the enemy had been discerned and flushed out!

Perception through hearing is the realm most of us are probably most familiar with. At times there may be the sound of bells, the telephone ringing, or even music. One of the most common sounds associated with spiritual perception is the sound of wind, such as occurred on the Day of Pentecost. One time, in the middle of the night, a supernatural wind came blowing through a closed bedroom window of our house. My wife, Michal Ann, and I were instantly awakened. Angels were released and messages from God came our way. With the wind came His presence!

No matter which of our senses bring us spiritual perception, we are tapping into a grace gift of God. Consistency and growth in this area calls for us to have our hearts set toward the Lord Jesus Christ. We cannot be living in open rebellion to Him. All of our affections must be focused on Him. We must be bathed in the blood of Jesus and have submitted ourselves to Him spirit, soul, and body.

Discerning of the Holy Spirit
Essentially, there are four categories of discerning spirits. The most important of these is the ability to discern the presence and work of the Holy Spirit. Two prominent biblical examples demonstrate this discernment in operation.

John testified saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him. I did not recognize Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’ I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God” (John 1:32-34).

After John baptized Jesus, he saw a dove descend and rest on Jesus. This was God’s sign to John identifying Jesus as the Son of God. Whether John saw a dove in the natural realm or the spiritual realm is not clear in the text. Either way, however, John knew it to be the Holy Spirit descending and remaining on Jesus. The only way he could know this was through the gift of discernment. Such knowledge was beyond normal human faculties.

When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them utterance (Acts 2:1-4).

The believers in the upper room were waiting for the fulfillment of Jesus’ promise made at the time of His ascension ten days earlier, that He would send the Holy Spirit to clothe them with “power from on high” (Luke 24:49). When the Spirit came on that Day of Pentecost, He appeared in two forms: wind and fire. There is no indication that these believers knew beforehand how the Spirit would appear, but when He came, they knew He was there. Once again, only the gift of discernment could impart this knowledge.

At times, my spiritual eyes have been opened, and I have seen a flame of fire over a person’s head or a flash of fire appear in front of an individual. This has been a helpful tool in knowing whom to minister to prophetically or for healing. I recall a time a large flame of fire stoked right up in front of a person. As I blessed what I saw the Father doing, this person was overwhelmed by the power of the Spirit and healed of chronic pain from head to foot. Thank the Lord—it works!

Discerning of Angels
Discerning of spirits also involves discerning of angels, because they are spiritual beings. Jesus saw an angel while He was praying in the Garden of Gethsemane:

He knelt down and began to pray, saying, “Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done.” Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him (Luke 22:41-43).

The text does not say how Jesus saw the angel, whether in the spiritual realm alone or in full bodily appearance, but He was strengthened by the angel’s presence. No one can see angels unless God enables it through the seer dimension of the gift of discernment. He does not release things without a purpose. If God enables us to see—whether angels or anything else—it is for a reason, and we need to search out that reason.

On the day of Jesus’ Resurrection, Mary Magdalene saw two angels when she visited the empty tomb:

But Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping; and so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been lying. And they said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” (John 20:11-13a)

Did Mary see these angels with her natural eyes or in the realm of the spirit? How did she know they were angels? The text does not say. Let it suffice that Mary had a spiritual experience in which she discerned the presence of angels.

These angels came to point Mary in a new direction. She came looking for Jesus’ body. They came to prepare her to meet her risen Lord, which she did immediately after this encounter. Seeing Jesus in the garden, Mary thought at first that He was the gardener. Upon recognizing Him at last, she fell at His feet in worship. Later, she went to the disciples and proclaimed, “I have seen the Lord” (John 20:18).

God sent angels to direct Mary to see Jesus as He really was rather than as she thought He was. Sometimes, if needed, He will do the same for us: to correct our vision so that we can get rid of false impressions and see our Lord as He really is.

Paul also saw an angel. In the middle of a great storm at sea, an angelic envoy delivered a message of hope and encouragement for the apostle and all who were on the ship with him. The next day, Paul shared his vision with the others:

“Yet now I urge you to keep up your courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. For this very night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood before me, saying, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those who are sailing with you’” (Acts 27:22-24).

Was Paul dreaming, or did he have an open vision? No one really knows. The important thing is that the message the angel brought was fulfilled just as promised. In the end, the ship ran aground and was beaten apart by the waves, but everyone aboard made it safely to land.

Discerning of Human Spirits
Another area of discernment is the ability to discern the human spirit—the true character or motive behind a person’s words or actions—even if hidden from casual view. Jesus possessed this ability to an exceptional degree. One example is His first meeting with Nathanael, one of His disciples.

Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” Nathanael said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.” Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!” Nathanael said to Him, “How do You know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” Nathanael answered Him, “Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel” (John 1:45-49).

Jesus was in one geographical location and Nathanael was in another, but in the realm of discerning of spirits, Jesus not only saw Nathanael, but He knew His inner character. Nathanael’s question about Nazareth sounds brazen and sarcastic, but Jesus saw a man who was transparent, a man who was not being outwardly religious and putting up all kinds of veneer, but who instead spoke his mind. When it came to matters of integrity and the truth, Nathanael did not play games. He did not think one thing and speak another. He had no hidden agenda.

Simon Peter demonstrated the ability to discern the condition of the human spirit when he encountered a sorcerer who was also named Simon. A resident of the city of Samaria, Simon the sorcerer professed faith in Christ after hearing the preaching and witnessing the miracles of Philip. So did many others in the city. After the church in Jerusalem sent Peter and John to Samaria to pray for the new believers to receive the Holy Spirit, Simon was amazed to see the power of the Spirit on display:

Then [Peter and John] began laying their hands on them, and they were receiving the Holy Spirit. Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money, saying, “Give this authority to me as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.” But Peter said to him, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! You have no part or portion in this matter, for your heart is not right before God. Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray the Lord that, if possible, the intention of your heart may be forgiven you. For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity.” But Simon answered and said, “Pray to the Lord for me yourselves, so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me” (Acts 8:17-24).

Peter had the ability to discern the true spirit and motivation that were in Simon’s heart. Once Peter exposed Simon’s duplicity, Simon may have had his own eyes opened to his sin, leading perhaps to his repentance.

The Book of Acts tells how Paul was able to discern faith for healing on the part of another person:

At Lystra a man was sitting who had no strength in his feet, lame from his mother’s womb, who had never walked. This man was listening to Paul as he spoke, who, when he had fixed his gaze on him and had seen that he had faith to be made well, said with a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet.” And he leaped up and began to walk (Acts 14:8-10).

No one can “see” faith. We can observe faith in action as it is demonstrated, but only the Spirit of God can impart the ability to discern faith in another. As for me and my house, I want this capacity!

Discerning of Evil Spirits
One area of discernment where we must exercise care, caution, and maturity is in the discerning of evil spirits. (Now remember our earlier chapter that presented “Nine Scriptural Tests for Wisely Judging Revelation”—the subjective is submitted to the objective!) Having reinforced that foundation, this kind of discernment can come through any one or more of the five senses. Have you ever been in a place or situation where you simply felt the presence of evil? What about a time, as I said before, where a rotten or unpleasant odor was present with no identifiable natural source? These are only two examples of how discernment of evil spirits may occur, but great sensitivity is necessary in walking in this arena.

In Luke 13:11-17, Jesus discerns an evil spirit as the cause of a woman’s physical affliction:

And there was a woman who for eighteen years had had a sickness caused by a spirit; and she was bent double, and could not straighten up at all. When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said to her, “Woman, you are freed from your sickness.” And He laid His hands on her; and immediately she was made erect again and began glorifying God (Luke 13:11-13).

This woman’s spinal curvature was caused by a spirit of infirmity, which is why she had never been able to find healing by natural means. When the synagogue leader criticized Jesus for healing on the Sabbath, Jesus replied:

“You hypocrites, does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead him away to water him? And this woman, a daughter of Abraham as she is, whom Satan has bound for eighteen long years, should she not have been released from this bond on the Sabbath day?” (Luke 13:15b-16)

Not every illness Jesus encountered was caused by an evil spirit, but this one was, and He discerned it and dealt with it. In the same way, we find some people today who are not healed immediately through prayer or laying on of hands. In some of these cases, a spirit of infirmity may be at work, which must be taken care of before healing will occur. In a visionary sense, such a spirit may be revealed as appearing like a leech on a person, sucking the strength out of whatever part of the body is afflicted.

Another biblical example is the account discussed earlier from the sixteenth chapter of Acts where Paul cast a spirit of divination out of a slave girl:

It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a slave-girl having a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing her masters much profit by fortune-telling. Following after Paul and us, she kept crying out, saying, “These men are bond-servants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation.” She continued doing this for many days. But Paul was greatly annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it came out at that very moment (Acts 16:16-18).

In this case, a sort of “double” discernment was at work. The spirit of divination (python) gave the slave girl the ability to discern the Holy Spirit in Paul and his companions. Paul, on the other hand, obviously recognized an evil spirit at work in the girl’s ability as a fortune-teller. Her description of Paul and his colleagues was accurate, but came from an evil source. The presence of such a spirit was quenching and hindering the work of the Holy Spirit, so Paul addressed the spirit of divination and cast it out of her.

Some of the common “symptoms” of the possible presence of evil spirits in a place are an oppressive atmosphere, a sense of confusion, a pervading sense of loneliness or sadness, a feeling of pressure, and depression. These are just a few examples; there are many more.

The Purpose of the Gift of Discernment
God never gives gifts or imparts spiritual abilities for no reason. Why is the gift of discernment, and the discerning of spirits in particular, so important? There is a sixfold purpose for this gift in the life of the Church:

Deliverance from demons. Demons must be discerned and exposed before they can be dealt with. Mark 5:1-19 tells the story of a man possessed by a “legion” of demons who was delivered from them at the command of the Lord. The New Testament contains numerous other accounts of demon-possessed people being delivered by Jesus or His followers. This ministry is essential today. Let Jesus’ prayer be answered, “Deliver us from evil!”
Reveal the servants of satan. Once, when Paul was sharing the Word of God with a Roman proconsul, he was opposed by a magician named Elymas:
But Elymas the magician (for so his name is translated) was opposing them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith. But Saul, who was also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fixed his gaze on him, and said, “You who are full of all deceit and fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to make crooked the straight ways of the Lord? Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and not see the sun for a time.” And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking those who would lead him by the hand. Then the proconsul believed when he saw what had happened, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord (Acts 13:8-12).
Expose and defeat the work and utterance of demons. This is clearly illustrated in Acts 16:16-18 when Paul casts the spirit of divination out of the slave girl. Word curses can be discerned and these hindrances broken in the name of Jesus. I have seen the whole atmosphere of a place change as authority is taken over demonic word curses and the power of God’s blessing is invoked. Greater is the power of the blessing than the power of the curse!
Expose error. Discerning of spirits reveals not only the workers of satan, but the errors of their teachings as well: “But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons” (1 Tim. 4:1). This operation of the Holy Spirit is especially needed in “religious” cities. God have mercy on us and deliver us from the slumbering effects of religious spirits. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom!
Acknowledge and confess Christ. “Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, ‘Jesus is accursed’; and no one can say, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ except by the Holy Spirit” (1 Cor. 12:3). It takes God to know God. Welcome the manifested presence of the Holy Spirit and watch the conviction of sin fall upon people. As the spirit of prophecy is poured out, people will fall on their faces and declare that Jesus is Lord (see 1 Cor. 14:24-25).
Know the moving of the Holy Spirit so as to cooperate with Him. “The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit” (John 3:8). Unless we recognize (discern) where and how the Holy Spirit is moving, we could find ourselves unintentionally working at cross-purposes to Him. Sensitivity at this point can help ensure that we always act in league with the Spirit. Declare with me, “Come, Holy Spirit—reveal Jesus!”
The late Jill Austin, a dear friend of mine and the founder of Master Potter Ministries, moved tremendously in this manner. I was with her often when she discerned the corporate move of God and, like John Wimber of Vineyard in the past, she declared, “Come, Holy Spirit,” and sure enough, power encounters happened all over the room!
Today a new group of believers are arising, like Joshua Mills, Ryan Wyatt, Steven Springer, Matt Sorger, Ryan Pena, Shawn Bolz and so many others. The baton has been passed and it is time for the faceless generation to arise!
Guidelines for Operating in the Gift of Discernment
Just as there is a sixfold purpose for the gift of discerning of spirits, I want to share six guidelines for walking uprightly and effectively in that gift.

Cultivate the gift. We can cultivate the gift of discernment by regularly exercising our spiritual senses, learning to give a spiritual interpretation of what our normal senses perceive during a visionary experience. Remember Hebrews 5:14: “But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil.”
Test the spirits. Don’t automatically assume that every vision or spiritual presence is from God. He commands us to test the spirits in order to distinguish the true from the false:
Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God; and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world (1 John 4:1-3).
Examine the fruit. One of the best ways to test the spirits is to look at the results, keeping in mind that fruit takes time to develop. That is why we should be careful not to enter into a quick judgment concerning whether or not something is of God, but take a little bit of time to watch. At the same time, however, we need to be sensitive to the “smell” of rotten fruit, so we can nip it in the bud. Does the activity draw people to Christ or pull them away from Him? Does it encourage them in righteousness or lead them into unrighteousness? Jesus said:
You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they? So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. So then, you will know them by their fruits (Matthew 7:16-20).
Discerning of spirits is not the gift of suspicion. It is easy to fall into the trap of using this gift to “see” things about other people and “report” what we see in a way that hurts or damages them. Like all spiritual gifts, this one should never be used for the purpose of gossip, slander, or manipulation, but rather for the edification and healing of those who are of the Body of Christ.
Wisdom, wisdom, wisdom! Wisdom is an absolute necessity in exercising the gift of discernment. In order for this explosive gift to be a boon and blessing for us and others in the Body of Christ, we must seek wisdom from above—a wisdom that is beyond our years and beyond our human faculties alone. Such wisdom comes only from God.
Intercede! Along with the gift of discernment may come faith to act or pray with authority. This is usually true of all the revelatory gifts. First, we should pray our revelation back to the Father and seek His application. Afterward, we may choose or be guided by the Spirit to release a command to rebuke the enemy. The key, however, is to always pray first for discernment so that we will know what to do in any specific situation.
The gift of distinguishing of spirits is needed today. Deliverance is needed today. Supernatural strength and aid are needed today! Though the term seer is used in the Old Testament, technically it is not used in the New. It is my view that the gift of discerning of spirits encompasses these seer perceptive capacities. Let’s call them forth and welcome them for the edifying of the Body of Christ.
