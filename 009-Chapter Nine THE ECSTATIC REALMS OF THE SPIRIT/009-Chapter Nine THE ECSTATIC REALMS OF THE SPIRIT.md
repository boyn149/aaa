# THE ECSTATIC REALMS OF THE SPIRIT 

Ever since November 1972, when I was filled with the Holy Spirit with the release of the gifts of the Spirit in my life, I have had a great love for the things of the Spirit of God. At the same time, however, I harbored for many years a suspicion of phenomena such as trances and out-of-body experiences. So many good things from God have been appropriated by the devil to the point that most people today automatically link such phenomena with New Age philosophies and the occult.

I was the same way until I decided to study the subject in depth and spent time around godly people who had a lot more experience with such things than I did. What I learned is that these kinds of phenomena originated with God; satan merely usurped and corrupted them as he did everything else. When properly understood and when initiated by the Spirit of God, a trance is an exciting, fabulous, wonderful thing, another powerful visionary experience that brings a person into the heavenly realm. The key is that such an experience must be initiated by the Holy Spirit only. It must never be self-induced.

A trance brings us into the “ecstatic” realm of the Spirit. As we saw in the last chapter, “trance” is one translation of the Greek word ekstasis, from which we get our English word ecstasy. Literally, an ecstatic trance is a displacement of the mind, a bewilderment that is commonly accompanied by amazement or astonishment. It is a distraction, especially one resulting from great religious fervor, and it often includes feelings of great joy, rapture, and delight that arrest the whole mind.

Ekstasis refers to “any displacement, and especially, with reference to the mind, of that alteration of the normal condition by which the person is thrown into a state of surprise or fear or both; or again, in which a person is so transported out of his natural state that he falls into a trance.”1

In his book, Prophetic Gatherings in the Church: The Laying on of Hands and Prophecy, Dr. David Blomgren writes:

A trance is a visional state in which revelation is received. This rapturous state is one in which a prophet would perceptively be no longer limited to natural consciousness and volition. He is “in the Spirit” where full consciousness may be temporarily transcended.2

David Castro, a dear prophetic brother from Brooklyn, New York, has written some of the most insightful material on this subject. He writes:

A trance is basically an ecstatic experience wherein one is more-or-less stupefied, stunned. Herein he is susceptible only to the visions God would impart. If a trance (a deep sleep from the Lord) occurs while the person is already asleep, any of the visual or actual kinds of supernatural dreams may be experienced. One may see visions, hear words (earthly or heavenly) or he may even leave his body and travel in the spirit for a special reason. Of course, these things are not to be self-induced, but experienced as the Spirit of God wills it.3

There are greater and lesser degrees of ecstatic experiences. The New Testament words amazed, amazement, and astonishment are also translations of the Greek word ekstasis. Hence, we see that both biblically and experientially, there are various degrees of trances.

One can be shocked, amazed, and joyfully “caught up” in one’s emotions due to the wondrous activity of the Holy Spirit. In a higher level of trance, one’s natural bodily functions are temporarily “put on pause,” and the person is caught up in the Spirit (whether in the body or out of the body is not the primary issue), and sees, hears, feels, tastes, touches, or even smells the presence of the Lord in an “otherworldly” or heavenly sort of way.

A brief look at a few scriptural examples of trances will help us better understand this type of visionary experience.

The Trance in The Scriptures
One of the most familiar accounts of a Spirit-induced trance is that of Simon Peter in the tenth chapter of Acts. In the early verses of that chapter, Cornelius, a Roman centurion who was “a devout man…who feared God” (Acts 10:2), receives a vision of an angel who instructs him to send men to Joppa to summon Peter. Cornelius immediately dispatches two servants and a devout soldier to the task.

On the next day, as they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray. But he became hungry and was desiring to eat; but while they were making preparations, he fell into a trance; and he saw the sky opened up, and an object like a great sheet coming down, lowered by four corners to the ground, and there were in it all kinds of four-footed animals and crawling creatures of the earth and birds of the air. A voice came to him, “Get up, Peter, kill and eat!” But Peter said, “By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything unholy and unclean.” Again a voice came to him a second time, “What God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy.” This happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into the sky (Acts 10:9-16).

During this experience, Peter was temporarily detached from the natural reality around him and saw an open Heaven. The primary purpose of this visionary trance was to prepare Peter for his assignment of entering the home of a Gentile and preaching to the people there. Devout Jews regarded Gentiles as unclean, and Peter needed to overcome his prejudice and learn not to think of other people as unclean just because they were not Jews. He needed to understand that the Gospel of Christ was not for Jews alone, but for all people.

Paul is another apostle who received revelation from God while in a trance. Accosted by a hostile crowd of Jews in Jerusalem and rescued by a band of Roman soldiers, Paul addresses the crowd. After briefly sharing with them his common heritage as a Jew and telling them of his conversion to Christ while on the road to Damascus, Paul then relates the account of his call from God to take the Gospel to the Gentiles:

And it happened when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I fell into a trance, and I saw Him saying to me, “Make haste, and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me.” And I said, “Lord, they themselves understand that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believed in You. And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed, I also was standing by approving, and watching out for the coats of those who were slaying him.” And He said to me, “Go! For I will send you far away to the Gentiles” (Acts 22:17-21).

I find it quite significant that, in both of these cases, the revelation given to Peter and Paul while they were in trances related to their call to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles. Sometimes God chooses unusual and remarkable means to reveal important insights or impart a significant anointing.

There are also numerous examples in the New Testament where people were in an “ecstatic” state that was not described specifically as a trance. Here are just a few:

“Immediately the girl got up and began to walk, for she was twelve years old. And immediately they were completely astounded [ekstasis]” (Mark 5:42). Jesus raised this young girl from the dead, leaving those who witnessed it (Peter, James, John, and the girl’s parents) in a state of ekstasis—profound astonishment.
“They went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment [ekstasis] had gripped them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid” (Mark 16:8). Mary Magdalene; Mary, the mother of James; and Salome experienced this ecstatic state of astonishment after seeing an angel in Jesus’ tomb who told them that He had risen.
“And they were taking note of him as being the one who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple to beg alms, and they were filled with wonder and amazement [ekstasis] at what had happened to him” (Acts 3:10). An ecstatic state of amazement was the response of those who witnessed Peter’s healing of a man lame from birth.
“But, so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,”—He said to the paralytic—”I say to you, get up, and pick up your stretcher and go home.” Immediately he got up before them, and picked up what he had been lying on, and went home glorifying God. They were all struck with astonishment [ekstasis] and began glorifying God; and they were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen remarkable things today” (Luke 5:24-26). This is the story where four men brought their paralyzed friend, dug a hole in the roof, and lowered him down in front of Jesus so that the Lord could heal him.
Concerning this last passage, David Castro writes:

Of the people present here, some were amazed, others glorified God, and the rest were filled with fear. Those amazed were “en-tranced” into the spiritual realm where they’re yielded and inclined to visions of the Lord; although God probably didn’t impart visions to all of them. These people were havin’ church! They made an effort to come to Jesus’ meeting. They came expecting miracles and they were gonna get theirs if they had to break through the wall—and they did! (Talk about bringing down da house!) And as the power of the Lord was present, they got a hold of the realm of the Spirit and went into ecstasy. God could’ve easily communicated to them by supernatural revelation if He wanted to. Probably some of them were “slain in the spirit.”4
Caught Up in the Spirit
The Bible also contains numerous instances of people undergoing possible trance-like experiences even though the word trance, or ekstasis, is not used. For example, Genesis 15:12 describes a “deep sleep” that fell upon Abram to prepare him for the revelation God was going to give him. God told Abram that his descendants would be slaves in Egypt for 400 years, but afterward would be set free and return to the land where Abram now was. Earlier, at God’s direction, Abram had brought a heifer, a goat, a ram, a turtledove, and a pigeon and offered them to the Lord, cutting the three larger animals in half and laying each half opposite the other. It was then that God “cut” His great covenant with Abram:

It came about when the sun had set, that it was very dark, and behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a flaming torch which passed between these pieces. On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I have given this land, from the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates” (Genesis 15:17-18).

Abram’s natural consciousness was put on “pause,” and he was brought up into the realm of the Spirit where God spoke His covenantal promises to His friend. This suspension of natural consciousness is a common characteristic of a trance-like state.

The prophet Ezekiel described many of his visionary experiences as being “lifted up” by the Spirit, which can also describe a trance-like condition:

“The Spirit lifted me up and took me away…” (Ezek. 3:14).
“The Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem…” (Ezek. 8:3).
“And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God to the exiles in Chaldea” (Ezek. 11:24).
“And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house” (Ezek. 43:5).
Daniel, like Abram, often received visionary revelation while in a “deep sleep.” After receiving a powerful vision concerning the endtimes, Daniel was trying to understand what he had seen. Gabriel was sent to explain the vision to him. “Now while he was talking with me, I sank into a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me and made me stand upright” (Dan. 8:18). Under the power of the Spirit, Daniel fell to the ground and in a “deep sleep” entered into a prophetic rapturous state.

On another occasion, Daniel saw a “great vision” of the Lord,

Yet no strength was left in me, for my natural color turned to a deathly pallor, and I retained no strength. But I heard the sound of his words; and as soon as I heard the sound of his words, I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground. Then behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees (Daniel 10:8-10).

We have already looked at Paul’s account of being “caught up to the third heaven” in such a state that he did not know whether he was “in the body” or “out of the body” (2 Cor. 12:2). The words caught up perfectly describe a trance-like state.

John the Beloved had similar experiences to Paul, which he describes in the Book of Revelation. He was “in the Spirit on the Lord’s day” when he heard behind him a voice like a trumpet. Turning, he saw “one like a son of man” in a long robe with a golden sash. His hair was as white as snow, his eyes blazed like fire, his face shown like the sun, and a two-edged sword came out of His mouth (see Rev. 1:10-16). John’s response to this shocking image is understandable:

When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. And He placed His right hand on me, saying, “Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last, and the living One; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades” (Revelation 1:17-18).

John was “in the Spirit,” saw a revelation of Christ in His glory, and “fell at His feet like a dead man.” Some people would say he was “slain in the Spirit,” and others would say that “the glory came down.” However we choose to describe it, John saw Jesus and prostrated himself in worship, perhaps completely overcome with the fear of the Lord and in a trancelike state.

A few chapters later, John describes another visionary experience:

After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, like the sound of a trumpet speaking with me, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things.” Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was standing in heaven, and One sitting on the throne (Revelation 4:1-2).

This time, instead of a vision of Christ, John saw God the Father, the “One sitting on the throne.” Once again, John was “in the Spirit,” and this state made it possible for him to see into Heaven. This was very possibly a trancelike state that caused John to be receptive to an open Heaven type of experience. Jesus had called John forth into visions of Heaven. As a result, he was able to behold sights in the third Heaven and also on the earth.

It is important to note here that one does not have to be in a trance to be in the Spirit. However, one who has experienced a trance may be properly said to have been in the Spirit.

As I said before, God does nothing without a purpose. His purpose in imparting visionary revelation, whether through a trance or any other means, is not just to give us an “experience,” but that we might see and know Him. We should not desire or seek visionary experiences for their own sake, but for how they can help us draw closer in deeper intimacy with our Lord.

Lest we think that supernatural trances were limited to biblical days, I want to share several testimonies of such experiences that date more closely to our own day. My desire is to demonstrate that trances from the Holy Spirit can be and are being experienced by “ordinary” Christians today.

“My Little Brother”
Dr. Mahesh Chavda is one of my dearest ministry friends, as his life and testimony have impacted me greatly. The story that follows is from his book, Only Love Can Make a Miracle, and tells how he took the final step to receive Christ as his Savior and Lord, becoming the first in his family to embrace Christ. Raised in Kenya by good Hindu parents from India, Mahesh was born into the upper caste—the warrior caste—of India and thus received a fine education while being groomed for leadership in government. This account begins after Mahesh learned about Jesus by reading the Gospels in a Bible given to him by a Baptist missionary.

In the end, I decided I simply couldn’t walk away from it all: my family, my training, my heritage. Part of me wanted Jesus, but I couldn’t bring myself to pay the price. And I couldn’t take the double-mindedness anymore.

For months now I had lived in agony. I would read the Gospels and find myself so attracted to Jesus that the next step—committing my all to him—seemed obvious and easy. Then the pull would go the other way, as I thought of the heartache I would cause my friends and family.

Finally, I had had enough. It was late one night. I was upstairs in my second-floor bedroom reading my Bible as I usually did. I was sitting at my desk, with a bed sheet wrapped around my body, pulled up over my head, and snuggled around my face, so that my eyes could just peer out. I had to do this because of the mosquitoes swarming around me. The mosquitoes were horrible in that part of Africa, and in those days we had no window screens and, of course, no spray cans of insect repellent.

My moment of decision had arrived at last. “No more,” I said to myself. “Enough is enough. I am never going to think about Jesus Christ again.” I despaired, thinking about leaving behind the one who I knew loved me so much, but I didn’t waver. I slowly, firmly closed the Bible. “I am never going to read this book again,” I said. “My mind is made up.” And that was that. Or so I thought.

The next thing I knew, I heard my head hit the desk…I seemed to be in a sort of half-sleep, no longer fully awake and in control, but aware of what was going on…

I immediately found myself in a strange and wonderful place. My body was still there at the desk, but in my spirit I was somewhere different, somewhere wonderful, somewhere I had never been before. The thought came into my consciousness, very simply and clearly, “I am in heaven.”

…The first thing I noticed was that I was walking on a street or pathway of some sort that appeared to be made of gold. It was different from any gold that I’d seen before. It seemed to be clear. You could almost see through it. Years later I read that when scientists purify gold with atomic particles, it becomes translucent. That’s what the gold on this pathway was like, as though it had been thoroughly purified.

Along both sides of the path was luxurious grass, like a thick blanket that you could lie down on and fall asleep. There were trees and flowers of every size and description. The colors were fantastic: yellows, greens, golds, blues, pinks—more colors and shades than I could have imagined…

These colors were different. It was as though they provided their own color from within. The light wasn’t reflecting off of them, it was pulsating from inside of them, in absolutely pure light…

I became aware that I was hearing music. At least, it was more like music than anything else I had ever experienced. It was as though the grandest symphony orchestra and the most splendid choir ever assembled were performing—though I could not distinguish particular instruments or voices. It was glorious.

I found my whole being dancing in keeping with the music. It was as though every one of my senses was perfectly harmonized with it. In fact, my overall sense was one of complete harmony, of perfection, of the total integration of everything around me…

I was somehow part of it: part of the splendor, part of the harmony, part of the perfection. I wasn’t just seeing and hearing and smelling what was around me. I was integrated into it. I didn’t just experience joy and love and purity and harmony, I somehow became part of them, and they became part of me.

I felt that I was home. This was where I wanted to be, where I was supposed to be. This was why I had been created.

…Suddenly, I became aware of a brilliant white light coming toward me. I turned and saw a man walking toward me. I knew immediately who it was. It was Jesus. Now bear in mind that I had never seen a depiction of Jesus…On the natural plane, I had no idea what he looked like. Yet there was not a trace of doubt in my mind that the man now walking toward me was him.

…I was almost blinded by the light that was streaming forth from him. It was bright and pure and alive, as if it contained the fullness of heavenly glory. I could hardly look at Him.

…As he came closer to me, I could see that he was smiling. It was…a smile of utter love and delight…

He came closer still, and I saw his eyes. I will never forget the eyes of Jesus. I could see that those eyes had felt every hurt, every heartache, that had ever been felt. They had shed every tear that had ever been wept on earth. Yet they were not eyes of sadness or gloom. They were eyes of triumph, eyes that seemed to say, “Yes, I know the pain, I know the heartache, I know the tears. I took it all upon myself when I died on the cross. But I have overcome. And you can overcome too.”

Then as I stood there gazing into his eyes, he stretched out his hand and placed it upon my shoulder and said to me, simply, “My little brother.”

As suddenly as it had begun, it ended. I was once again on the second floor of my house with my bed sheet drawn around my face and my head resting on my Bible—but something strange had happened. When all this had started, when my head had fallen forward onto the desk, my Bible had been closed. I had just made a decision never to open it again. Now, however, it was open. I looked down and I saw that it was opened to chapter eighteen of Luke’s Gospel, the story of the rich young ruler.

…I heard a voice within me say to me, “Are you going to turn away from me the same way he did?”

I said, “No, sir.”

Then I did something that, to my knowledge, no ancestor of mine had ever done, that no one in all the eight hundred years of our family history could even have imagined doing. I got down on my knees and said, “Jesus, I’m sorry. Please forgive me for all the wrong things I’ve done. I want you. I want to give my life to you. Please come and live in my heart.”5

Mahesh’s account is an incredibly beautiful and accurate description of how the Holy Spirit brings a person into contact with the love and grace of God. Through the years since that night, Mahesh has been used mightily by God in a worldwide ministry of evangelism and healing and other miracles.

“My Senses Were Suspended”
The life and ministry of Kenneth E. Hagin were profoundly influenced by his visions of Jesus. Here is his account of his third vision, which occurred one evening in December 1952 in Broken Bow, Oklahoma.

One night after the service, we had returned to the parsonage and were having a sandwich and a glass of milk in the kitchen. As we talked about the things of the Lord, time slipped away from us.

The pastor’s little girl was sitting there with us, and finally she became sleepy and said, “Daddy, it’s getting late, and I have to get up early in the morning to go to school. Won’t you come pray with me now?” It was their custom that he always prayed with her at night and then tucked her into bed.

The pastor looked at his watch and exclaimed, “It’s 11:30! Why, I never dreamed it was that late. We have been sitting here talking for two hours.” Then he said to his daughter, “Come here honey. We’ll just kneel down here and Brother Hagin can have prayer with us. Then you can go to bed.”

As we knelt together in that kitchen, each of us beside a chair, I was in the Spirit before my knees ever touched the floor…

On this night in 1952 in the parsonage kitchen, my physical senses were suspended. At that moment I didn’t know I was kneeling beside a kitchen chair. It seemed as if I was kneeling in a white cloud that enveloped me.

Immediately I saw Jesus. He seemed to be standing above me, about as high as the ceiling is from the floor. He began to talk to me. “I am going to teach you concerning the devil, demons, and demon possession,” He began. “From this night forward, what is known in my Word as the gift of discerning of spirits will operate in your life when you are in the Spirit.”6

Dr. Hagin then goes on to describe how the gifts of the Spirit and, particularly, the gift of discerning of spirits, were in operation in him only when he was in the realm of the Spirit. In other words, it was not at his choice or volition, but only when he was, in his words, “in the anointing.”

“A Wonderful Display of God’s Power”
Maria Woodworth-Etter was a powerful evangelist and revival leader of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Wherever she went, the power of God fell: people were slain in the Spirit, saw visions, received revelation, and were converted by the thousands. Her book, Signs and Wonders, her personal account of the first 40 years of her ministry, contains perhaps some of the most insightful and incredible material that has ever been written on the arena of trances and supernatural manifestations of the Holy Spirit. The account that follows took place in January of 1885, and it is only one of the many amazing displays of God’s sovereign power recorded in her book.

The church was cold and formal, and many of the best citizens had drifted into skepticism. I knew that it would take a wonderful display of God’s power to convince the people, so I prayed for God to display His power, that the sinner might know that God still lives, and that there is a reality in religion, and might convict him of a terrible judgment. Five of the leading members of the church said they would unite with me in prayer for the Lord to pour out the power from on high, till the city would be shaken, and the country, for miles around. We prayed that Christians and sinners might fall as dead men; that the slain of the Lord might be many. The Lord answered our prayers in a remarkable manner.

The class leader’s little boy fell under the power of God first. He rose up, stepped on the pulpit, and began to talk with the wisdom and power of God. His father began to shout, and to praise the Lord. As the little fellow exhorted and asked the people to come to Christ they began to weep all over the house. Some shouted; others fell prostrated. Diverse operations of the Spirit were seen. The displays of the power of God continued to increase till we closed the meeting, which lasted about five weeks. The power of the Lord, like the wind, swept all over the city, up one street and down another, sweeping through the places of business, the workshops, saloons and dives, arresting sinners of all classes. The Scriptures were fulfilled. The wicked flee when no man pursueth. Men, women and children were struck down in their homes, in their places of business, on the highways, and lay as dead. They had wonderful visions and rose converted, giving glory to God. When they told what they had seen their faces shown like angels.’ The fear of God fell upon the city. The police said they never saw such a change; that they had nothing to do. They said they made no arrest; and that the power of God seemed to preserve the city. A spirit of love rested all over the city. There was no fighting, no swearing on the streets; that the people moved softly, and that there seemed to be a spirit of love and kindness among all the classes, as if they felt they were in the presence of God.

A merchant fell in a trance in his home and lay several hours. Hundreds went in to look at him. He had a vision, and a message for the church. The Lord showed him the condition of many of the members. He told part of his vision, but refused to deliver the message to the church. He was struck dumb. He could not speak a word because he refused to tell what the Lord wanted him to. The Lord showed him he would never speak till he delivered the message. He rose to his feet, weeping, to tell the vision. God loosed his tongue. Those present knew he had been dumb, and when he began to talk and tell his experience it had a wonderful effect on the church and sinners.

One night there was a party seventeen miles from the city. Some of the young ladies thought they would have some fun; they began to mimic and act out the trance. The Lord struck some of them down. They lay there as if they had been shot. Their fun-making was soon turned into a prayer-meeting, and cries of mercy were heard. The people came to the meeting in sleigh loads many miles. One night while a sleigh load of men and women were going to the meeting they were jesting about the trances. They made the remark to each other that they were going in a trance that night. Before the meeting closed all who had been making fun were struck down by the power of God and lay like dead people, and had to be taken home in the sleigh in that condition. Those who came with them were very much frightened when they saw them lying there, and they told how they had been making fun of the power of God on the way to the meeting. Scoffers and mockers were stricken down in all parts of the house.

One man was mocking a woman of whose body God had taken control. She was preaching with gestures. When in that mocking attitude God struck him dumb. He became rigid and remained with his hands up, and his mouth drawn in that mocking way for five hours, a gazing-stock for all in the house. The fear of God fell on all. They saw that it was a fearful thing to mock God or make fun of His work. Surely, the Lord worked in a wonderful way in this meeting. The postmaster was converted. All classes from the roughs and the toughs to the tallest cedars and brightest talents of the city were brought into the fold of Christ. We took the meeting to the opera house and it would not hold the crowds, so great was the awakening among the people.7

“Drops of Pure Crystal Light”
Annie is a woman who was brought to Christ out of a life of agnosticism, rebellion, great pain, and suicidal tendencies. Throughout her life as a Christian, Annie has been blessed by God with hundreds of vivid and powerful visions. Many of these have been recorded in a series of books edited by the late R. Edward Miller, the evangelist under whose ministry she found Christ and received a great deliverance. The following account is called “Showers” and is drawn from the book I Looked and I Saw the Lord.

I was before the Lord on the evening of the 8th of July, seeking His face and pouring out my heart before Him, when suddenly I was There. In the Spirit I found myself surrounded by a sweet, powerful force of love. It not only surrounded me but invaded me to the inmost part of my being. At the same time it brought with it such a deep sense of peace, of security, and of well-being. I saw myself encircled by those beautiful angels with their wings folded irradiating light and loving care. Jesus was with me in this angelic circle. His glory shined all around and upon all. He was just like I had last seen Him and He was just loving me. It was just like being inside a dense, transparent, invisible but tangible cloud of pure LOVE. As I was completely covered in this bright cloud of love it began to rain.

It rained, and rained, and rained. But what a strange rain it was. It was not like rain on this earth because it was not wet at all. It was a heavenly rain and it rained all the time I was there. The large drops were like drops of pure crystal lights, or like small diamonds that had light and life inside them. They fell from above so softly and smoothly like little stars. I played and played with the rain drops, catching them in my hands. Although each one gave me such a sense of joy and pleasure, my hands did not get wet. Although of substance, they were still so light and airy and I carried them about in my hand. I laughed and laughed from pure pleasure and the angels laughed to rejoice with me as if they were enjoying my joy. Jesus showed me that this was His rain of blessing.

Later I was so amazed for in the service that night there was a prophetic word concerning the beautiful showers of rain that He was even now sending upon His people. I felt so joyful for I had been given to see and feel and play with that very rain.8

Biblically and historically, the trance has been a legitimate method God sometimes has used to impart visionary revelation, and it continues to be so today. My purpose here is not to promote trances. My purpose is to promote the Kingdom of God. If He wants to use this seer revelation as one of His vehicles to help tune us in to His kind will, then I say, “Bring it on!” Ultimately, God’s desire is to bring us close to Himself and impart His will and His ways to us so that we can minister to others in wisdom because we have spent time standing in the council of God.
