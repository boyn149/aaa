# VISION - THE POWER THAT SUSTAINS 

Moses had ascended Mount Sinai to meet with God. He had been gone over a month. In the valley below, the people of Israel, newly freed from slavery, began to wonder about his fate. Perhaps they believed a wild animal had killed him or that he had fallen from a cliff and died. In any case, the people came to Aaron, Moses’ brother and spokesman, and induced him to make for them a “god,” a golden image to go before them. They said to Aaron, “This Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him” (Exod. 32:1b).

Aaron took gold from the people and fashioned from it a molten calf, which the Israelites installed as their god, the one who had brought them out of Egypt. Then the people began to worship the calf and to celebrate with dancing and singing. They offered burnt sacrifices to the calf and indulged themselves in licentious play and behavior, perhaps like what they had seen in Egypt (see Ex. 32:2-6).

On the mountain, God saw what the people were doing and was prepared to destroy them, but Moses interceded on their behalf. The Lord relented and spared the people. Moses came down from the mountain, confronted the people, and in a symbolic gesture illustrating their disobedience, broke the tablets of the law at the foot of the mountain. He then destroyed the golden calf.

Seeing that the people were “out of control” (Exod. 32:25), Moses called out, “Whoever is for the Lord, come to me!” (Exod. 32:26). When “all the sons of Levi” gathered to Moses’ side, he sent them out to put to death the instigators and leaders of the rebellion. In the end, 3,000 Israelites died that day.

This incident from the Book of Exodus illustrates perfectly the truth of Proverbs 29:18: “Where there is no vision, the people are unrestrained, but happy is he who keeps the law.” This verse in the New International Version reads: “Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint; but blessed is he who keeps the law.” Some other translations, such as the New Revised Standard Version, use the word prophecy instead of vision or revelation. The point is clear: without prophecy, without divine revelation or vision, people will cast off all restraint. They will run wild because they have no guidance—no vision. The Word of God—His law—provides vision and guidance for living, and those who follow it are blessed. All people need a vision to sustain them in life.

William Blake, the noted British artist and poet of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, was also a visionary. He first began seeing visions as a child and continued to do so throughout his life. This visionary capacity profoundly influenced his life and work:

In later years Blake habitually talked about the supernatural subjects of his pictures as being actually present in his studio when he was drawing them. A visitor once surprised him hard at work on a picture of an invisible sitter. He looked and drew, drew and looked, apparently intent on capturing a likeness. “Do not disturb me, I have one sitting to me,” he said. “But there’s no one here,” exclaimed the visitor. “But I see him, sir,” replied Blake haughtily. “There he is—his name is Lot—you may read of him in the Scriptures. He is sitting for his portrait.”1

Some of Blake’s best work, both artistically and poetically, was inspired by the visions that sustained him.

In the year AD 312, Constantine and Maxentius were rivals in the fight over who would be emperor of the Roman Empire. Both men and the forces under their commands drew up battle lines at the Milvian Bridge over the Tiber River. On the day before the battle, Constantine had a vision of a flaming cross outlined against the sun. On the cross were the Greek words En touto nika, which mean, “In this [sign] you shall conquer.” The next morning, Constantine had a dream in which a voice commanded him to have his soldiers mark on their shields the chi ro—the monogram for Christ. Constantine obeyed, fought Maxentius, and won,2 becoming emperor of Rome—and the first Roman emperor to embrace the Christian faith. Constantine had a vision that sustained him, led him to victory, and changed his life.

“Where there is no vision, the people perish” (Prov. 29:18a KJV). Unrestrained behavior leads eventually to destruction. People who have no vision also have no goal or purpose—nothing to shoot for. They have nowhere to go in life and, therefore, go nowhere.

As Christians, we are called to be a people of vision. We must learn to set a goal or target in front of our eyes to gaze upon. It is only when we aim at something that we have any chance of hitting it! The apostle Paul set his sights on knowing Christ, which he acknowledged was a lifelong process:

Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, have this attitude (Philippians 3:13-15a).

Like Paul, we need to be a people of vision. Let us set our sights on the Lord and aim at His goals.

The Vision That Sustained Elisha
Elisha, who succeeded Elijah in prophetic ministry, was a man of vision. Even as a young man, Elisha hungered for more of God, and his hunger made him tenacious in pursuit of his goal. He kept before his eyes a vision of the Lord that sustained him through a life of ministry even greater and more miracle-filled than Elijah’s.

When the time drew near for Elijah to leave and be taken up into Heaven, Elisha would not leave his side. Three times the Lord instructed Elijah to go to a specific place—Bethel, Jericho, and the Jordan. Three times Elijah requested that Elisha stay behind, but Elisha refused each time. At the Jordan, Elijah struck the waters with his folded cloak, the waters parted, and the two men crossed over on dry ground.

Impressed and encouraged by Elisha’s tenacity, Elijah wanted to find out what he was really after:

When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken from you.” And Elisha said, “Please, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.” He said, “You have asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so.” As they were going along and talking, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire which separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind to heaven. Elisha saw it and cried out, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” And he saw Elijah no more… (2 Kings 2:9-12a).

What exactly did Elisha see? Obviously, he saw Elijah being taken up to Heaven, because the verses that follow these make it clear that Elisha did receive a double portion of the spirit that had been upon Elijah. However, Elisha’s own words make it clear that he saw more than this: “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” The words “my father” may refer to Elijah, whom Elisha certainly regarded as a mentor and father figure. It is also possible that Elisha, at the moment of his anointing, caught a glimpse of God the Father Himself—or at least of the glory that surrounds Him, since Exodus 33:20 says that no one can see God and live.

As for “the chariots of Israel and its horsemen,” this may be a reference to the innumerable company of the army of the heavenly host. Whatever Elisha saw, he was profoundly and deeply affected by the vision, and that vision sustained him throughout the rest of his life.

If you remember from Chapter One, this was not the only time Elisha saw a heavenly army of chariots and horsemen. When the king of Aram sent his army to surround Dothan and capture Elisha, Elisha’s servant was terrified until Elisha prayed for his eyes to be opened. That is when the servant saw what Elisha saw: chariots of fire and horses surrounding them. Once the servant saw the divine army that was invisible to natural vision, his fear went away.

Elisha was a man of vision, a man of revelation, and he never let go of it. What about you? I don’t know what prophetic promise the Lord may have spoken to you. As Christians, we have the biblical promises as well as the current-day revelatory words that are spoken into each of our lives, which come in a multiplicity of manners. Sometimes they come by the quiet, still witness of the Spirit; at other times, through dreams or visions. They may come from God directly to you or through someone speaking to you what they have received from God.

Whatever the case, don’t cast away your dream, for it will have a great reward. Don’t take off your dream coat in the presence of your enemy. Keep the vision God has given you before your eyes. Vision is a power that sustains a people.

The Vision That Sustained Jacob
Jacob is another Old Testament character who was sustained by a vision. Having fled his home to escape the murderous wrath of his brother, Esau, Jacob lay down to sleep in the wilderness.

He had a dream, and behold, a ladder was set on the earth with its top reaching to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. And behold, the Lord stood above it and said, “I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie, I will give it to you and to your descendants. Your descendants will also be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and in you and in your descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed. Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you” (Genesis 28:12-15).

For the next 21 years, Jacob worked for his uncle Laban, who also became his father-in-law when Jacob married his daughters Leah and Rachel. Laban was somewhat of a trickster and deceiver, just as Jacob was. Jacob worked seven years to get Rachel as his wife, only to end up with Leah, who was the older. He got Rachel as well, but had to work another seven years in return. Jacob labored an additional seven years in order to build up his own flocks and herds in preparation for returning to his homeland. In the process, Laban changed Jacob’s wages ten times and tried in other ways to cheat him, but God was always at work behind the scenes, keeping His promise to Jacob.

Finally, when Jacob was preparing to leave, Laban tried to get him to stay by offering to pay whatever Jacob asked for as wages. Jacob replied that the only wages he desired were all the striped, speckled, and spotted sheep and goats in Laban’s herds, as well as all the black lambs. Laban readily agreed, then hastened to place all the animals that fit that description into the care of his sons and sent them on a three-days’ journey away. It seemed as though Laban had cheated Jacob again.

Jacob was undeterred:

Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white which was in the rods. He set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the gutters, even in the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink; and they mated when they came to drink. So the flocks mated by the rods, and the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted. Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put his own herds apart, and did not put them with Laban’s flock. Moreover, whenever the stronger of the flock were mating, Jacob would place the rods in the sight of the flock in the gutters, so that they might mate by the rods; but when the flock was feeble, he did not put them in; so the feebler were Laban’s and the stronger Jacob’s. So the man became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks and female and male servants and camels and donkeys (Genesis 30:37-43).

Jacob took fresh rods from poplar and almond trees (trees symbolize authority), peeled white stripes in them, and placed them in the watering troughs for the sheep and the goats. When the animals came to drink, they also mated (symbolizing intimacy) in front of the peeled rods. The resulting offspring were striped, speckled, and spotted. Jacob did this only when the stronger animals were mating, so he ended up with the strongest and healthiest flocks, while Laban’s animals were weaker.

Jacob prospered greatly because the sheep and goats brought forth the right kind of offspring. They produced the desired result because there was a vision that was put in front of their eyes, and they begat what was put in front of them. This illustrates the principle that vision is the power that sustains. Whatever we keep in front of our eyes is what will determine our outcome!

The Vision That Sustained Zechariah
Like the Books of Daniel and Revelation, the Book of Zechariah contains many visions and apocalyptic images. Zechariah was a visionary prophet whose visions related specifically to the time after the Babylonian exile and the beginning of the Messianic period in Israel’s history.

One of Zechariah’s visions is the context for one of the most-quoted verses in the Old Testament:

Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. He said to me, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.” Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, “What are these, my lord?” So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, “Do you not know what these are?” And I said, “No, my lord.” Then he said to me, “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel saying, ‘Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,’ says the Lord of hosts. ‘What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of “Grace, grace to it!” ” ’ (Zechariah 4:1-7)

An angel came and roused Zechariah as if from a deep sleep. Have you ever been startled or awakened in the middle of the night and felt as though a spiritual presence was in the room? Perhaps you sensed the presence of God or His holiness, or you simply had a conscious awareness that God was there. It may have been exactly that way with Zechariah. One of God’s “ministering spirits” (see Heb. 1:14) woke Zechariah in order to show him the vision and explain its meaning. This is the same way the Lord works with many of His seer vessels today as well.

In his vision, Zechariah saw an elaborate golden lampstand with two olive trees on either side of it. His first response was very intelligent. He asked the angel, “What are these, my lord?” Asking a question is a wise course of action whenever visionary revelation occurs. That is a lesson I learned from Zechariah. No matter what I see or how many times I think I may have seen it before, I always ask, “What is this, Lord?” I am confident that the same God who gives me the revelation can also interpret it for me.

Even when the angel asks him specifically, “Do you not know what these are?” Zechariah answers with humility, “No, my lord.” Had Zechariah not responded with humility and openness, he probably would not have gained much from the whole experience. People who think they know it all already cut themselves off from learning anything new.

Years ago, when I was younger in these ways of God, I and a few others would spend some time with the parabolic seer, Bob Jones, in his home. He would tell us some pretty awesome and unusual things he had “seen.” He would always ask us one last question. “Did you get that?” We would stay poker-faced, nod our heads and say, “Sure, we got that!” Then we would get in our vehicles and chatter, “Did you understand that?” I probably missed a lot I could have learned by not responding in humility. But I have since changed a few of my ways! I now respond a lot more like Zechariah!

As it turns out, Zechariah’s vision had to do with a message for Zerubbabel, the civic official of the returning exiles under whose leadership the temple in Jerusalem would be rebuilt. The word of the Lord to Zerubbabel was, “Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit” (Zech. 4:6). This was meant as an encouragement to Zerubbabel and the rest of the returning exiles that a new era was beginning, an era characterized by the working of God’s Spirit in power and the coming day of the Messiah.

A new epoch of the Spirit was at hand. This was the vision that sustained Zechariah and, by extension, Zerubbabel and all of the returning exiles. It encouraged and motivated them to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem, as well as the walls of the city and the city itself, which had been destroyed by the Babylonians. Vision sustains a people, and humility is a key that releases understanding!

The Vision That Sustained Daniel
Daniel was a prophet who regularly moved in the visionary realm. Essentially, visions can be classified into two varieties: internal and external. An internal vision is the kind that we sometimes call an impression or a mental picture. We see the picture with our mind’s eye, but the picture itself comes from the Lord. An external vision is what we also sometimes call an open vision, where we see the vision with our natural eyes, but it’s often superimposed over whatever is going on in the natural world around us. Daniel moved in both.

In the seventh chapter of the Book of Daniel, the prophet records his summary of a graphic and powerful vision he received while in bed one night:

Daniel said, “I was looking in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. And four great beasts were coming up from the sea, different from one another. The first was like a lion and had the wings of an eagle. I kept looking until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man; a human mind also was given to it” (Daniel 7:2-4).

These verses contain two important phrases that help explain Daniel’s success as a visionary prophet: “I was looking” and “I kept looking.” As soon as the vision began, Daniel was looking for its meaning and kept looking until the end. One of the dangers I have become aware of in walking in the prophetic seer capacity is what I call revelation fixation: becoming so impressed with what we see that we quit looking. We get hung up on the images themselves to the point where we stop seeing and never press on to understand their meaning. It is as though we think the vision is an end in itself rather than an instrument God wants to use to teach us something.

Daniel did not let himself get caught up in revelation fixation. Throughout the course of the vision he said, “I kept looking.” He was determined to stay alert to the end so he could understand what God was fully showing him.

In his vision, Daniel saw a succession of four beasts rise from the sea. The first was like a lion with eagle’s wings. The wings were plucked off, the lion stood on two feet like a man, and a human mind was given to it. Next came a beast like a bear, which was told to “devour much meat.” The third beast was like a leopard with four bird’s wings and four heads, and which was given dominion. Daniel “kept looking” and saw the fourth beast, “dreadful and terrifying and extremely strong; and it had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet…” (Dan. 7:7b). It also had ten horns. As Daniel continued to watch, another, smaller horn grew and ripped out three of the other horns and took their place. This horn “possessed eyes like a man and a mouth uttering great boasts” (Dan. 7:8b).

What Daniel was witnessing was a vision of the revival of evil. He did not let it rest there, however, as he “kept looking.” Because it is vision that sustains a people, Daniel wanted to look beyond the revival of evil to see the Lord’s response to it. He was not disappointed:

I kept looking until thrones were set up, and the Ancient of Days took His seat; His vesture was like white snow and the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne was ablaze with flames, its wheels were a burning fire. A river of fire was flowing and coming out from before Him; thousands upon thousands were attending Him, and myriads upon myriads were standing before Him; the court sat, and the books were opened. Then I kept looking because of the sound of the boastful words which the horn was speaking; I kept looking until the beast was slain, and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire. As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was granted to them for an appointed period of time. I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven One like a Son of Man was coming, and He came up to the Ancient of Days and was presented before Him. And to Him was given dominion, glory and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations and men of every language might serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion which will not pass away; and His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed (Daniel 7:9-14).

Unimpressed with the visionary revelation concerning what the evil one was going to do, Daniel kept looking for something higher, an even greater revelation. He did not give in to revelation fixation. Daniel did not stop looking until he had seen a vision of the Son of man and His Kingdom being extended throughout the earth.

Like Daniel, we live today in the midst of a revival of evil, so we need a vision to sustain us as a people—a vision that shows us clearly how the promises of God are more than all the power of evil. Let us then be a people of vision who will not perish, but will walk together in hot pursuit of the Lord, so that we too will be able to hold before our eyes an all-consuming vision of the conquering Son of Man and the Ancient of Days sitting upon His throne. Keeping our vision of the Lord clear before us will sustain us through the many labors of our lives and ministries.

Seeking the Vision That Sustains Us
Over the years, I have become convinced that in the Christian life at least two things are certain: God never changes, and we are always changing. Our lives as Christians are a continual transition from one place to another, one level to another, one understanding to another. The purpose of spiritual light is to bring us into change and growth. The more light we have, the more change we experience; and the more we change (for the better), the more we are brought into higher levels of glory. Unless we are in constant transition, we will stop somewhere along the way and settle down. The Christian life is a frontier. God did not call us to be settlers, but to be pilgrims and pioneers.

This is the point of Paul’s prayer in the first chapter of Ephesians:

That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him…that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe (Ephesians 1:17-19a).

The more enlightenment we have, the more wisdom and revelation we are open to receive, and the greater understanding we can develop of the hope of His calling, the glory of His inheritance, and the surpassing greatness of His power as they apply to our lives.

Once, years ago, I was in a particularly troubling time of transition and was seeking the Lord’s guidance. Different voices and different people were speaking to me, wanting me to join this team or do that ministry or whatever, and I was confused. I simply did not know what the Lord wanted me to do.

As I was up early one morning seeking the Lord, I had an experience. Although I love experiences, they are not the foundation of my life. My life is founded on the Word of God, prayer, and Jesus—the rock of my salvation. Experiences are simply the icing on the cake, but what delicious icing!

While praying on the living room couch early that morning, I watched through the sliding glass door as the sun rose. For one short moment, a beam of sunlight coming through the venetian blinds lit across my forehead, and the thought came to me, “I will give you a shaft of revelation light.” In that moment all my confusion dissipated. I did not hear anything or have any internal knowing of what my decision was to be. My spirit was simply at rest in the confident knowledge that the Lord was revealing it to me.

What is the hope of the Lord’s calling on your life? Ask Him to give you a vision of it, and don’t stop asking. Keep on looking until you see it. Don’t look just for a project or for something to do; look for a vision of Him! Pray that the eyes of your heart will be enlightened and your spiritual vision enhanced. Ask that a revelatory shaft of light would enter your spirit so that you would know the hope and the expectation of good for your life. Remember that what you keep in front of your eyes is what you will become. Present your eyes, your mind, your heart—your whole self—to the Lord and ask Him to grant you the spirit of revelation. Ask Him for the vision that will sustain you.
