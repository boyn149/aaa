# DIMENSIONS OF THE PROPHETIC ANOINTING 

They called it “the storm of the century.”

In March 1993, a friend and I were traveling in New England, where I was scheduled to speak at a total of six meetings in three different cities. Our itinerary included New Haven, Connecticut; Providence, Rhode Island; and Kingston, Massachusetts. I believe the very names of these cities were significant, particularly in light of what happened. New Haven is a place of peace, a place of respite and rest. Providence has to do with the will of God, and Kingston (or Kingstown) refers to the place where the king lives and from where he rules.

We were in New Haven, Connecticut, when the entire upper third of the eastern seaboard of the United States was slammed with a snow and ice storm propelled by 80 mile-per-hour winds. Holed up in our little cottage in the hills, we watched as snow and sleet in equal measure blew down.

In the end, only three of the six scheduled meetings took place, and attendance at those three was only about one-fourth of what it would have been otherwise. Nevertheless, that trip turned out to be a true divine appointment for us. Because of the storm, there were no meetings at all that Saturday, but it turned out to be a real joy for me that they did not happen. Rather than feeling remorse or worrying that we had somehow missed God and ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time, we knew we were exactly where we were supposed to be. While we were snowed in, watching the awesome power of nature and of nature’s God, we had some wonderful time of just waiting on the Lord.

As we waited and prayed together, simply meditating before God’s presence, He brought me into a realm where I began speaking prophetically, even though no one else except my friend was there to hear me. I felt at that time that the Lord was sharing part of His heart with me.

While watching a news broadcast, we heard the local story of a pregnant woman who went into labor during the storm and had to be dug out of her house in order to go to the hospital. She reached the hospital just in time to give birth to a healthy baby boy, whom she and her husband named Joshua. As a result, the local news media began referring to the blizzard as “the Joshua Storm.”

As I pondered on that name, I felt the voice of the Lord inside me saying quietly, “Yes, there is a new anointing for a new generation: My Joshua generation.” Like Joshua of old, who succeeded Moses as leader of the Israelites, a “Joshua generation” receives the baton from the generation that has pioneered and gone before it. It is a generation that takes the promises spoken to an earlier generation and crosses over into the “Promised Land” to possess it and to conquer the enemies that are there.

Today there is a new anointing for a new generation, a Joshua generation of people who will be born into the things of the Spirit in the midst of a great spiritual storm that is sweeping across our land. Let’s take a closer look at this anointing.

Understanding the Prophetic Anointing
Many Scriptures throughout the Bible speak of the anointing. Psalm 92:10 says, “You have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; I have been anointed with fresh oil.” Fresh anointing oil is what we need if we are going to be able to fulfill that which the Lord has already spoken of so clearly.

Isaiah 10:27 speaks of the power of the anointing to break the yoke of bondage, evil, and oppression:

It shall come to pass in that day that his [the king of Assyria’s] burden will be taken away from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck, and the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil (NKJV).

The anointing also carries the power to do good and bring healing:

You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him (Acts 10:38).

Essentially, the anointing is the supernatural enablement or grace—the manifested presence of the Holy Spirit—operating upon or through an individual or a corporate group to produce the works of Jesus. It means God with you and God in you; you are talking His talk and walking in His shadow.

As an anointed people, we as the Body of Christ have been called to carry a prophetic-type burden that will cause us to live on the cutting edge of God’s eternal purpose. The prophetic ministry is but one aspect of the fivefold calling of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. As such, it is resident to a degree in every ministry and more evident and active in certain ones. God’s ultimate weapon is a man or a woman who has encountered the prophetic anointing. God does not anoint projects; He anoints people!

People anointed with a prophetic ministry speak the word of the Lord in the name of the Lord. They carry weight in the Church by virtue of the ethical, moral, and spiritual urgency of their message. Their credentials, credibility, and status as prophetic vessels stem not from birth or by official designation, but by the power of their inner call and by the response of those who hear them.

The single most characteristic mark of true prophetic people is the evidence that they have stood in the counsel of God and have therefore faithfully declared what they heard from His mouth. According to William Robertson Smith, it is this divine word that distinguishes a prophet:

The possession of a single true thought, not derived from current religious teaching, but springing up in the soul as a Word from Jehovah, Himself, is enough to constitute a prophet.1

Usually, prophets make no special claim to be heard, but are content to speak and act and leave the matter there, confident not in themselves, but in the fact that they have heard from God and that every word from Him will find fulfillment. Their primary concern is not with the distant future, but to tell forth the will of God in the crisis of their own days. Prophets, then, are essentially interpreters of God.

The prophecies of the Old Testament prophets foreshadowed Christ. The major task of New Testament prophets and beyond has always been to declare that in Christ all the prophecies of the Bible have been fulfilled:

And likewise, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and his successors onward, also announced these days [i.e., the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ] (Acts 3:24).

As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you made careful searches and inquiries, seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow (1 Peter 1:10-11).

For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy (Revelation 19:10b).

Remember that prophecy itself is the expressed thoughts of God spoken in a language that no people in their natural gift of speech could articulate on their own. The substance and nature of prophecy exceed the limits of what the natural mind could conceive. Prophecy comes through the mouth of people, but from the mind of God—spiritual thoughts in spiritual words.

The prophetic anointing of the Spirit makes itself known in a wide variety of ways. People are different, with different personalities, cultures, ethnic backgrounds, and gifts. As Rick Joyner often states, no two snowflakes are alike! It should not be surprising, then, that there is a greatly divergent expression of the ministry and office of the prophet. Although there surely are more, I want to look a little more closely at 12 variations of this prophetic grace. These various models represent what the Spirit is doing and desires to do in the Church. Together they present a more complete picture of the fullness of the Lord’s prophetic anointing.

Dreamers and Visionaries
Obviously, these are prophetic individuals who move primarily in the realm of dreams and visions—seers, in other words. Depending upon the particular sphere of ministry and authority God has given them, they may be released into a large public platform, or their prophetic sphere may be reserved for smaller settings such as their local church, business, family, or home group. In some cases their calling may be primarily private in nature, limited to their personal prayer closet and shared only with family members, or, as occasion permits, a few other people. The Lord does not give a prophetic anointing in a void. Large or small, every dreamer and visionary has a “market” or a sphere that he or she can influence.

The main purpose of this dream-and-vision anointing is to awaken the people of God to the spirit realm. It is a miraculous manifestation of the Spirit that creatively illuminates truth and can confirm the direction of God that has been given to others. A good biblical example is the prophet Zechariah (see Zech. 4.) In our own day, Bob Jones, John Paul Jackson, Paul Cain and others exemplify this seer prophet realm in an unusual manner.

Prophets Who Proclaim God’s Corporate Purpose
People who display this expression of the anointing, while true prophetic vessels, may rarely or never prophesy over individuals in personal ministry. Their sphere of operation and authority is different. Especially gifted to discern the times and the seasons, they give clarity to the overall direction and purpose of the Body of Christ, enabling and encouraging the Church to rise up into full maturity.

Paul is the perfect New Testament example. Although an apostle and a teacher, Paul also walked under a strong prophetic anointing that revealed itself as a profound revelatory gift for uncovering and explaining the large corporate purpose of the Church.

One contemporary example could be Rick Joyner. Although Rick is an authentic seer, his emphasis is not on individual, personal prophecies. Rick is almost always found in the sphere of prophetically declaring and interpreting the corporate purposes of God for our day. Dr. Bill Hamon’s teaching and many books also reveal God’s overall prophetic purpose for His corporate Church, while Francis Frangipane, Tommy Tenney, and others point to the corporate direction the wind is blowing, too.

Prophets Who Proclaim God’s Heart
Standards for His People
People under this anointing challenge the Church by calling for holy thoughts, intentions, motives, convictions, and methodologies in every arena of life. That is what it means to proclaim God’s heart standards for His people. Their purpose is to usher in the fruit of the Spirit, nurture the character of Christ, and promote purity and holiness. Biblical examples of this prophetic anointing would be Jeremiah in the Old Testament and John the Baptist in the New Testament.

A good contemporary example of this anointing was the late David Wilkerson, who released the plumb line of God into the Church even as he declared the standards of holiness in a prophetic manner. Just because he did not see visions, or individually lay hands on people, or call people out by name does not mean he was not prophetic. On the contrary, perhaps he was a prophet evangelist, releasing the Word of God in an evangelistic manner that changed lives. Thank God for others like Steve Hill and Michael Brown, who call us into radical obedience to the Word of God.

Prophets Who Proclaim
the Church’s Social Responsibilities and Actions
This expression of the prophetic anointing calls to the Church to care for the widow, the orphan, the poor, the oppressed, and the prisoner—in short, all the needy who have no power and no champion for their cause. The purpose is to establish righteousness and justice. Amos in the Old Testament was just such a prophet. In the fifth chapter of the book that bears his name, he says, “But let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream” (Amos 5:24).

In recent years, Norm Stone, with Walk America for Life, has been this kind of prophet. His lifestyle goes somewhat against the grain of the Church and the nation. God has given him a unique and unusual prophetic call to prayer walk across the United States from border to border—seven times—declaring the atrocities of abortion and pricking the hard hearts of the Church and of the nation to convict us of our social and moral responsibility. Though often a thankless job, it is a vitally needed ministry.

Another dear friend of mine in Nashville, Tennessee, is Scott MacLeod with Provision International. Though he is first a prophetic psalmist, he has given his life to the ministry of the poor in the inner-city projects of the city I live in. Mark Roye, who heads up our own Compassion Acts, is such a champion, as is Patricia King, with her global thrust of justice and mercy. They are some of the growing number of champions who call us to put feet to our faith by taking the prophetic to the streets.

Prophets Who Speak Forth the Administrative Strategy
of God With a Political Slant
Wait a minute! Prophets with an administrative gift? Isn’t that a right brain/left brain conflict? Not at all! Moses was a prophet, and so were Joseph and Daniel. All three of these Old Testament men of God carried a strong prophetic anointing, yet all were extraordinarily gifted with administrative and leadership ability.

Moses needed quite a bit of political savvy to lead 3 million people out of 400 years of slavery and get them organized into a coherent nation. Joseph moved in the seer realm as an interpreter of dreams. His prophetic gifting to see what was coming put him in a unique position to speak the counsel of God to those who were in political authority. As second-in-command to Pharaoh, Joseph was a powerful and able administrator. Daniel also moved in the seer realm of revelatory dreams and visions, yet he was the most capable of all the leaders and administrators under the king of Babylon.

During my teenage years, the Lord laid on my heart a couple of prayers that I began to pray regularly. The first was, “Lord, raise up your Josephs. Raise up your counselors to the Pharaohs.” Sometimes God puts something within you, and you don’t even fully understand why it’s there, let alone how it got there. All you know is that God has dropped into your spirit a deposit of grace that inspires you to begin praying for something or someone specific that you would never have dreamed of yourself. As a young man, I felt a burden to pray for the Lord to release counselors to those who were in authority.

The other prayer I began to pray was, “Lord, I ask that you give me a heart of purity.” Jesus said, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God” (Matt. 5:8). Oh, how I wanted to see the Lord! I cried out for a heart of purity, and I still do.

As God imparts this “political savvy,” those who receive it reveal deep administrative skills and devise strategies that release and help foster the wise and smooth implementation of God’s purposes. This is just what Joseph did in Egypt as he prepared the country to survive during seven years of famine.

Today, Dr. Kingsley Fletcher exemplifies this grace in an amazing manner. He is both a senior pastor of a church in North Carolina and a king of the nation of Ghana, calling forth change in society. There are many such statesmen and stateswomen whom God is raising up for such a time as this. What a concept to strategically know by revelation what to do and how to implement it! Lord, expand our horizons and raise up these history-makers!

Prophetic Worship Leaders Who Usher in the Manifested
Presence of God Through Prophetic Worship
Prophetic worship leaders help release people into the liberty of both expressing their love for God and receiving God’s love. Under their prophetic leadership, the gifts of the Spirit flow and operate more freely. Because they are carriers of the Spirit, they can help lift others into His marvelous presence where change occurs. Jesus is truly exalted and enthroned in the praises of His people (see Ps. 22:3).

The prime biblical example is David who, in addition to being a shepherd and a king, was also a prophetic psalmist. Half or more of the psalms in the Bible were written by David. As a young man, he played his harp and sang, causing demons to flee from King Saul. What a combination!

Several examples of the prophetic psalmist in our own generation would be David Ruis, Julie Meyer, Sean Feucht, Matt Redmon, Misty Edwards, and Jeff Deyo. A new breed of radical Salvation Army bands are hurtling forth on the scene. A fresh combination mixing evangelistic and prophetic graces is emerging to impact the lost for Jesus’ sake. But many of this new breed of holy warriors will find their expression primarily through music.

Prophetic Intercessors
Under this anointing, a person receives a burden from God that releases intercession that can affect individuals, communities, cities, and even nations. Depending on the measure of sphere and authority granted by the Lord, a prophetic intercessor may move under a particular international burden.

In the Old Testament, Daniel prayed three times a day for the release of the children of Israel from Babylonian captivity. He interceded for their return to their home and for their restoration (see Dan. 6:10, Dan. 9).

The second chapter of Luke tells of Anna, a prophetess and widow who “never left the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers” (Luke 2:37b). Although not a single personal prophecy of hers is recorded, the Bible does say that she devoted her time to fasting and prayer. Anna was a prophetic intercessor.

It takes a strong prophetic spirit to endure in prayer before the Lord even when much time goes by with nothing seemingly happening. Without such an anointing, people become hopeless, disappointed, and discouraged to the point of giving up. The anointing for prophetic intercession imparts the grace to endure. You don’t just pray to God, but you learn to pray the prayers of God!

For me personally, my anointing seems to be deepest in this area of prophetic intercession. God has given me the faith for it as well as the grace to impart it to others. It is awfully hard to give away something you do not have. Among all the things I do, this has been the strongest anointing upon my life. Cindy Jacobs of Generals International, Beth Alves of Increase International, Chuck Pierce of Global Spheres, Lou Engle of TheCall, Tom Hess, Dick Simmons, and thousands of others make up this army of revelatory prayer warriors.

The next five are expressions of the prophetic anointing that I believe the Holy Spirit wants to release on a wider scale and has even begun to do so.

Spirit-Bearers
John 3:8 says, “The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.” This is a word for every believer. All of us who are born-again are to catch the wind of the Spirit.

There are some people, however, who seem to have an anointing to catch that wind more than others. They wet their finger, stick it up in the air to find out which way the wind is blowing, then set their sails and follow that wind wherever it goes. To others they may appear flighty or even slightly crazy, but they don’t care because they are caught up in following the wind of the Holy Spirit in their lives.

Through a love-walk with the Lord they practice the presence of Jesus. God uses these prophetic Spirit-bearers to release unusual manifestations of the Holy Spirit in the midst of a corporate people. There may be people falling in the Spirit, quaking, shaking, ecstatic speech, power encounters, or kingdom clashes of angelic and demonic warfare. Sometimes they will move in the realm of the angelic presence, even perhaps in a realm where they simply blow on people and an activity of God occurs.

The late Jill Austin, who was a dear friend of mine and the leader of Master Potter Ministries, was a modern-day Spirit-bearer. When she showed up, He showed up! Spirit-bearers’ main purpose is to be with Jesus and to get up in front of people and say, “Come, Holy Spirit!” They are used to create a connecting point between Heaven and earth and bring Him into the place.

Prophetic Counselors
People with this anointing combine pastoral caring and healing understandings with the prophetic. There is a tremendous need for this kind of ministry today because so many people are so full of hurt and trauma and turmoil. Prophetic counseling often mingles the spirit of counsel and the spirit of understanding as stated in Isaiah 11:2:

The Spirit of the Lord will rest on Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.

Sometimes prophetic counselors also display gifts of healing and discerning of spirits: yet their primary concern is not the big picture, but the wholeness of the internal affairs of men and women on a personal or family basis.

Both compassionate and revelatory, they are able to see into the hurts and wounds of individuals, and they can help release the spirit of understanding. With their prophetic insight and ability to listen, they can help other people quiet their souls and ease their troubled hearts. John and Paula Sandford of the Elijah House Ministries are indeed a father and mother of this sphere. Joan Hunter has picked up the mantle of her parents “the Happy Hunters” and moves in a prophetic healing grace. The global Healing Rooms Ministries led by Cal Pierce and many others are examples of these prophetic healers in our day and age!

So many people get so excited about all the amazing things that happen in meetings, but so much more happens in little gatherings and one-on-one counseling, as troubled individuals come face-to-face with the love, compassion, and healing power of the Lord through the ministry of sensitive and gifted prophetic counselors.

Prophetic Equippers
This is a prophet/teacher combination. All the offices of the fivefold ministry—apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher—are provided for equipping the Church; but some folks seem to have a special grace for equipping others. Some prophetic equippers may perform their ministries primarily through modeling, without significant involvement in individual people’s lives. Others learn by listening to them speak and by watching their lives.

Many other prophetic equippers, however, function most effectively through direct interaction with other people in a teaching setting. They possess the teaching grace with a prophetic flare, which enables them to explain to others the ways of the Spirit taking the bizarre and making it practical, relatable, and understandable. Their call and desire is for the discipling of other believers with a particular burden for multiplication through mentoring, which is much-needed today.

The late John Wimber, former leader of the Vineyard Movement, was one of the most profound equippers I ever met. While his seminars where full of the power and presence of God, students were always given detailed notes and training sessions to help them learn “to do the stuff.”

Dr. Bill Hamon, through his schools and prophetic training, has activated and equipped thousands of prophets and prophetic ministers located on every continent of the world. He has raised up many men and women, such as Sharon Stone, Jane Hamon and so many others. Thank the Lord for these activists and equippers!

Kris Vallonton and the Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry, in Redding, California, might just have the highest level of impartation today! Thank the Lord that new leaders are emerging and coming forth!

Prophetic Writers
Prophecy is not limited to the verbal and the visual; it may also come forth in written form. Although not as common, perhaps, as the spoken forms of prophecy, prophetic writing is just as valid. People with this anointing are just as prophetic as anyone else. The difference is that they have the gift and bent to communicate more powerfully and effectively through the written word than through the spoken word.

Over the years, I have seen many prophetic people who were awkward in front of people, but give them a pen and paper or a computer and watch out! On the other hand, I have also seen many powerful speakers with incredible charisma and “stage presence” who could hardly jot down two sentences together coherently, much less write a book. The written word and the spoken word are quite different, and there is a prophetic anointing for each.

Prophetic writers write with revelatory anointing, expressing in printed form God’s heart to contemporary society. Gene Edwards is marvelously used in this manner to poetically paint pictures that draw the reader into His Majesty’s courts.

Graham Cooke, of Vacaville, California, is probably one of the best examples of this convergence in recent years. His works are filled with wisdom, jewels of the journey with great prophetic insight.

Another past example of a revelatory piercing writer is the late Francis Schaeffer, founder of L’Abri Fellowship. Dr. Schaeffer was a powerful communicator through the written word, a true prophetic writer and statesman whose books and other writings continue to convict and challenge the Church worldwide 25 years after his death.

There are many other voices today, older and younger, who walk in this anointing. Yes, trendsetters like Rick Joyner of MorningStar Ministries, Dutch Sheets, Julia Loren, Sister Gwen Shaw of the End-Time Handmaidens, and Servants and so many others. New voices with the pen of the ready writer are upon us!

Prophetic Evangelists
These are the ones who take the revelatory gifts to the streets, stadiums, neighborhoods, health clubs, executive places—anywhere and everywhere. How desperately our society needs people who move in the anointing of the prophetic evangelist! This anointing does not necessarily mean getting up in front of hundreds or thousands of people and preaching. Some prophetic evangelists will do that, of course, but most will operate in a smaller and more intimate sphere. One of the real needs is for evangelists in the ordinary, day-to-day places that we all know: the elevator, the grocery store, the bus, the ball field, the gas station, the doctor’s office, the campus, the boardroom—anyplace where people interact.

Mahesh and Bonnie Chavda rattled my world. Through the prophetic and apostolic giftings upon their lives, they have seen hundreds of thousands come to faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. But other such champions are also arising on the scene today, like Patricia King, Mickey Robinson, Jeff Jansen, Munday Martin and scores of others who are breaking down the Church’s walls and thrusting a people forth to take action.

How eager the Lord is to release Holy Spirit activity in the everyday world through the lives and words of faithful prophets who carry the prophetic evangelist anointing!

Poison and Antidote
Clearly then, the prophetic anointing manifests in many diverse ways. All arise from the same Holy Spirit, who gives as He wills. With this in mind, a warning is in order. There is a deadly poison that can kill our ministry and our ability to walk in our anointing, whatever it may be: the poison of covetousness. Comparing ourselves to someone else and wanting what they have produces death. We should never judge or evaluate our anointing by someone else’s anointing. It is vitally important to avoid jealousy and insecurity. God has plenty of anointing to go around. Let’s be satisfied to seek our own calling and walk in our own anointing.

The antidote to this poison is to learn to walk in accountability with others, cultivating faithfulness, while giving ourselves to the unique expression of grace that God has imparted to each of us. Sometimes we are prone to allow ourselves to be hindered by rejection, criticism, legalistic traditions, and the restrictive yokes and molds of others’ unrealistic and erroneous expectations.

The Holy Spirit will help us and liberate us to be unique and varied expressions of His wonderful prophetic presence and yet walk circumspectly with integrity within the Church. God has never been in a box. We are the ones in boxes! It is time to let the Holy Spirit take the lid off so that, in gratitude to Him, we can become all that we can be in Him. Let’s let His anointing break the yoke. Instead of wishing we were somebody else or had what somebody else has, let’s be faithful and accountable to walk in the unique expression of grace that God has given to each of us.
