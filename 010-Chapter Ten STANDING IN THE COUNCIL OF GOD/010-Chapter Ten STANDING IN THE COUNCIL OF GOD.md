# STANDING IN THE COUNCIL OF GOD 

Across the spectrum of the Christian Church today, many questions arise and much debate occurs concerning the legitimacy of prophetic and visionary ministry. Many Christians hear about others’ claims to having angelic visitations or being caught up in the Spirit or being brought up before the throne of God, and they ask, “Are these things biblical?” Sometimes the question comes from a mind-set of doubt, skepticism, and disbelief; at other times, it arises from an attitude of genuine curiosity. More and more believers are beginning to examine these things out of a desire to know and understand more about these mystical ways.

Proverbs 29:18 says, “Where there is no vision, the people are unrestrained, [or perish] but happy is he who keeps the law.” What kind of vision will keep a people from perishing? A vision from the Lord. How do they get such a vision? God imparts vision to people who open their hearts to Him, who are sensitive to His Spirit, and who spend much time in intimate fellowship with Him. The Lord gives vision to those who, in the words of Jeremiah, have “stood in the council of the Lord”:

But who has stood in the council of the Lord, that he should see and hear His word? Who has given heed to His word and listened?…But if they had stood in My council, then they would have announced My words to My people, and would have turned them back from their evil way and from the evil of their deeds (Jeremiah 23:18,22).

What does it mean to “stand in the council of the Lord”? Compare this passage to some verses from the Book of Habakkuk:

The oracle which Habakkuk the prophet saw (Habakkuk 1:1).

I will stand on my guard post and station myself on the rampart; and I will keep watch to see what He will speak to me, and how I may reply when I am reproved (Habakkuk 2:1).

Jeremiah speaks of seeing, hearing, giving heed to, and listening to the Word of God. Habakkuk refers to seeing an oracle and describes himself as a guard on the rampart, keeping watch to see what the Lord will speak to him. These words sound a similar theme to those of Isaiah:

On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen; all day and all night they will never keep silent. You who remind the Lord, take no rest for yourselves; and give Him no rest until He establishes and makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth (Isaiah 62:6-7).

How can anyone “see” what the Lord “speaks”? The simplest answer is that God has more than one way of “speaking.” His speech is not limited to audible words or, indeed, to words of any kind. In the prophetic realm, to stand in the council of God means both to see and to hear the Word of God. But for what purpose? Jeremiah 23:22 gives the answer: to announce God’s Word to God’s people in order to “[turn] them back from their evil way and from the evil of their deeds.” In other words, the purpose of standing in the council of God is to produce fruit in the lives of God’s people: the fruit of holiness, repentance, the fear of the Lord, and a godly lifestyle.

In Close Deliberation1
The Hebrew word for “council” in Jeremiah 23:18 is cowd, which means “a session,” or “a company of persons in close deliberation.” It implies intimacy, as in secret consultation. By comparison, our English word council refers to a group of people called together for discussion or advice. Within the Church at large, a council is a formal assembly convened to discuss points of doctrine or theology. Within a business, a council is brought together to bring divergent thoughts together to formulate the best plan or way to proceed.

Just as there are earthly councils of men and women who come together to discuss and advise, there is also a council that takes place in Heaven, presided over by Almighty God, where we can hear and receive the counsel of the Lord—the wisdom and vision and direction that derive from the council of God. By His sovereign and personal invitation, we can enter God’s “hearing room” to listen to the deliberation of His council so as to be able to announce His Word on an issue.

Let’s examine some Scriptures that refer in one way or another to this council of God—people joined together with God in close deliberation.

Were you the first man to be born, or were you brought forth before the hills? Do you hear the secret counsel of God, and limit wisdom to yourself? What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that we do not? (Job 15:7-9)

In these verses, Eliphaz, one of Job’s friends, is rebuking Job for standing by his own wisdom while dismissing that of Eliphaz and his companions, Bildad and Zophar. While there certainly is a strong element of resentment and even jealousy in Eliphaz’s tone, the important thing to note here is that he assumes that there is such a thing as “the secret counsel of God.”

The Lord has revelation—secrets, if you will—that He wants to open up to us. Normally, we do not share secrets with just anyone. Most of us confide our deepest and most intimate things only with trusted friends. One of the highest characteristics of a prophetic person is that he or she is supposed to be a trusted friend of God. God has secrets, and He is looking for some friends to share His counsel with. It is an open invitation; we all can be friends of God.

Who has directed the Spirit of the Lord, or as His counselor has informed Him? With whom did He consult and who gave Him understanding? And who taught Him in the path of justice and taught Him knowledge and informed Him of the way of understanding? (Isaiah 40:13-14)

Also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will (Ephesians 1:11).

The implication in the Isaiah passage is that no one instructs or counsels God; on the contrary, He instructs and counsels us. He is our teacher. Paul’s words in Ephesians imply that because of our inheritance from the Lord, we can be brought into the place of “the counsel of His will.”

The prophet Amos wrote, “Surely the Lord God does nothing unless He reveals His secret counsel to His servants the prophets” (Amos 3:7). This verse reveals a very important principle at work in the Kingdom of God: God’s prophetic people are to be His friends. They are to be the ones to whom He can entrust His word, His message, and His revelation; He often speaks to them beforehand about what He is going to do.

Why does God speak to His servants the prophets before He acts? Is God not sovereign? Can He not do whatever He wants to do without informing any of us? Absolutely, but God has chosen to work this way because at Creation He gave the stewardship of this earth to humanity. He established a chain of command, so to speak. God has never rescinded His original decree giving humankind dominion over the earth. That is why He says, in effect, “Before I do anything, I will let someone—my friends—know what I am about to do.”

God always acts with purpose. He reveals His secret counsel to us because we are His friends, but He also reveals it in order to get a job done—to accomplish His will.

It is very important that we recognize and accept our place as servants of God. As believers, we are God’s friends—just as we are co-heirs with Christ—but our friendship with God is characterized by love as well as by faithful obedience and service. We find our identity not in who we are or what our title is, but in Christ and in servanthood. Who we are is not determined by what we do, but to whom we belong. If we are “in Christ,” our lives are in Him. He is our life.

A prime example of Amos 3:7 in action is found in the twentieth chapter of Genesis. God’s intention is to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah because of the sinfulness of the people; but before He does, He reveals His plan to Abraham. Although Abraham intercedes for the cities, God destroys them because fewer than ten righteous people are found there. Abraham’s nephew, Lot, his wife, and their two daughters are delivered from Sodom before it is destroyed. Because of Abraham’s intercession, several members of his extended family are rescued from destruction.

There are two sides to the coin of standing in the council of God. On one side is the sovereignty of God, and on the other, the initiative of people. One of the amazing truths of the Bible is that the announced intention and counsel of God can be altered by our intercession!

Another important aspect of standing in the council of God is a sense of being in Heaven—in His very throne room. In his book called The Throne Room Company, seer Shawn Bolz describes his experience of witnessing the radiance of His glory when the Heavens opened:

When the heavens opened to me, the atmosphere of Heaven was thick with intense purity in the air. Many spiritual beings surrounded me. An angel guided me into the center of a very large room, which I realized was God’s throne room. It had no visible walls; the room seemed as endless as God’s awesome presence.

In the center of the room was the glorified Son. His presence was so bright that the pure light coming from His face felt like a walk into the heart of a nuclear explosion. Yet somehow, He gave me grace to be able to walk toward Him.

Although I understood that God dwells in an approachable light, this experience of His glory caused me to become undone. How can those who are unholy come into the very presence of Holiness without shattering into a million particles? God’s very covenant of love was my assurance that I was safe. I held on to it as though it were a contract in my hand, because I was so overwhelmed by the fear of the Lord.

This time I wasn’t allowed to get very close. However, just being in such nearness to God was overwhelming. I just stared at Him, the King of all glory. I felt like I was crying out of sheer joy, but no tears fell. It was as if my spirit contained the emotion of weeping, but expressed it so much deeper—with a deep sense of astonishment.

Just gazing at God was an act of worship. I didn’t have to try to produce words or songs; my whole being was alive in His presence and completely adored Him. It is a natural, automatic response in the midst of His glory.

I was only able to gaze upon Him for a few minutes. I knew if I stayed there much longer, I would not be willing to return to earth. So, the angel interrupted my sweet communion with Jesus. It was the only time my angelic companion felt awkward. We looked at each other with complete understanding and then we both obeyed.2

Daniel describes this in the seventh chapter of his book when, after seeing his vision of the four great and terrible beasts, he goes on to speak of a heavenly council:

I kept looking until thrones were set up, and the Ancient of Days took His seat; His vesture was like white snow and the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne was ablaze with flames, its wheels were a burning fire. A river of fire was flowing and coming out from before Him; thousands upon thousands were attending Him, and myriads upon myriads were standing before Him; the court sat, and the books were opened (Daniel 7:9-10).

“The court sat.” There was a session, a deliberation in the council room of the Most Holy One. The purpose of a court is to hear a case. In this case, the deliberation resulted in the promise of judgment against the beasts Daniel had seen earlier in his vision. Dominion would be taken from them and given to the Son of Man and His saints forever and ever (see Dan. 7:13-18).

As far as Daniel was concerned, this experience seemed real enough for him to have been present bodily at the heavenly council. Standing in the council equates “being there,” as some revelatory people term the experience.

“Being There”
In Second Corinthians 12:1-4, Paul’s famous account of being “caught up to the third heaven,” the apostle mentions three possible states in which this could have happened: “in the body,” “out of the body,” and “apart from the body.” Paul himself did not know which state he was in when he had this experience, and it really was not important. What was important was what he saw and heard and learned during the experience.

Carlton Kenney, a renowned Bible teacher and a missionary statesman in Japan for many years, has drawn a distinction between the three states of the body that Paul mentions:

In the body—a subjective experience where we are spectating. This could relate to various forms of dreams and visions as in Acts 9:10; 10:3; 15:9 and 18:9.
Apart from the body—a subjective experience where we not only spectate but also interact or dialogue. Possible examples are trances and other experiences as in Acts 10:10,19; 11:5 and 22:17.
Out of the body—a subjective experience where we not only spectate but move about in the spiritual realm. Ezekiel gives us numerous examples of this as in Ezek. 1:1,3; 3:22; 8:1-11:5,13; 37:1 and 40:1.3
An experience of “being there” in the council of God is significant for several reasons. First of all, it is an honor when God grants this kind of audience. Second, the more subjective the experience, the greater the possibility of pure revelation. Finally, our own thoughts are out of the process, and reception in the spirit realm is in clearer focus.

These are important factors to consider because they help us establish the proper mind-set for walking in that realm. After all, if God grants us the privilege of such a supernatural encounter as standing in His council, we had better know how to act when we are there. God gives us instruction for this in His Word. Consider this verse:

Thus says the Lord of hosts, “If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here” (Zechariah 3:7).

Here are God’s conditions for standing in His council: “walk in My ways and…perform My service.” This involves progressive steps of faithfulness followed by His supernatural enablement. If we do the little things, God will do the big things. He will watch over His promises that we will govern His house, have charge of His courts, and have free access to those who are standing there. I want this in my life! Don’t you?

Who are the ones who are “standing here”? Primarily, they are angelic beings, although the Son of God is certainly present as well.

I saw at night, and behold, a man was riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him. Then I said, “My lord, what are these?” And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, “I will show you what these are.” And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, “These are those whom the Lord has sent to patrol the earth.” So they answered the angel of the Lord who was standing among the myrtle trees and said, “We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet” (Zechariah 1:8-11).

Zechariah sees, hears, and speaks to angels, as well as to a man on a red horse, who is also described as “the angel of the Lord.” This phrase is a common Old Testament reference to an appearance of the Son of God, the second person of the Trinity—Christ in His pre-incarnate form. Notice Zechariah’s humility; he did not know what it was he was seeing, so he asked for an explanation. He did not put on a “know-it-all” air or get caught up in “revelation fixation.” Such humility characterizes Zechariah throughout the book that bears his name.

Daniel was the same way. Whenever he did not understand part of a vision, he asked one of those “standing by” to explain it to him. After his powerful vision of the four great beasts and the Son of Man who defeats them, Daniel was puzzled by what it meant:

I approached one of those who were standing by and began asking him the exact meaning of all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things (Daniel 7:16).

Zechariah and Daniel (as well as all the other prophets and people who had these kinds of encounters with the Lord) knew they were in the presence of God, and that realization filled them with a holy fear; and their humility grew out of that holy fear. One way to identify an authentic encounter with the Lord is that a holy fear arises in the spirits of all who experience that encounter.

How then should we walk among those who are standing by in the council of the Lord? What should be our demeanor in His presence? The key—the only acceptable posture—is a spirit of humility in the holy fear of the Lord.

This leads us to three important guidelines to help protect us from error during supernatural encounters such as these:

Avoid unhealthy familiarity and fascination with their personage. In Revelation 19:10, John is tempted to worship the angel who is speaking to him: “Then I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, ‘Do not do that; I am a fellow servant of yours and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus; worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.’”
Watch out for the issue of “commanding angels” in spiritual warfare encounters. How do we handle such a touchy topic? Let Jesus be our guide. At the time He was betrayed and arrested, Jesus said to His disciples, “Do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?” (Matt. 26:53) Even the Son of God Himself would seek angelic help not directly, but by appealing to His Father. We should do the same; we should appeal to our Father, the One who sits on the throne.
Be careful to use proper discernment in the distinction between the true angelic and the demonic counterfeit. All true spiritual warfare centers on the placement of the Son. Don’t be deceived. Remember that both heavenly angels and fallen angels, and especially satan, can appear like lightning. Paul said, “Even satan disguises himself as an angel of light” (2 Cor. 11:14). Another key to success in this area is to make sure we have dealt with forgiveness issues so that satan cannot take advantage of us: “But one whom you forgive anything, I forgive also; for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did it for your sakes in the presence of Christ, so that no advantage would be taken of us by satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes” (2 Cor. 2:10-11). Releasing forgiveness is one of the highest tools of spiritual warfare. It nullifies the enemy’s ability to gain a foothold in our lives.
The Hindrance of an Evil Heart
No matter how prophetically gifted we may be, our ability to flow in the full power and revelation of the prophetic depends on the purity of our hearts and the closeness of our walks with the Lord. The gifts and calling of God are without repentance. This means that we may still operate at some level of prophetic revelation even if we are not walking close to the Lord, but we will never reach our full potential as long as we remain in that condition.

Jeremiah the prophet provides us with a good list of the kinds of things we need to watch out for. The entire twenty-third chapter of the Book of Jeremiah is an indictment of the shepherds (spiritual leaders) and prophets in Israel for their failure to honestly and responsibly lead the people in the ways of the Lord. According to Jeremiah, these were the sins of the prophets of Israel:

Using their power unjustly—
As for the prophets: my heart is broken within me, all my bones tremble; I have become like a drunken man, even like a man overcome with wine, because of the Lord and because of His holy words. For the land is full of adulterers; for the land mourns because of the curse. The pastures of the wilderness have dried up. Their course also is evil and their might is not right (Jeremiah 23:9-10).
This gets into the issue of manipulation: Why do we want this revelation, and what will we do with it once we have it? God knows the condition of our hearts. A wrong motive hinders revelation.
Mixing the sources of their message—
“Moreover, among the prophets of Samaria I saw an offensive thing: They prophesied by Baal and led My people Israel astray” (Jer. 23:13). This involves mingling the things of the flesh and the world with the things of the Spirit. The result is pollution of the message. We may need some personal cleansing in our lives before we can be fully usable to the Lord.
Engaging in immorality—
Also among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: the committing of adultery and walking in falsehood; and they strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one has turned back from his wickedness. All of them have become to Me like Sodom, and her inhabitants like Gomorrah (Jeremiah 23:14).
An immoral lifestyle clogs up the channel through which God’s revelation and blessings can flow.
Speaking from their own imagination—
Thus says the Lord of hosts, “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you. They are leading you into futility; they speak a vision of their own imagination, not from the mouth of the Lord” (Jeremiah 23:16).
We must constantly guard against speaking our own opinions and trying to hang on them the authority of the Lord.
Speaking peace when there is no peace—
They keep saying to those who despise Me, “The Lord has said, ‘You will have peace’”; and as for everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart, they say, “Calamity will not come upon you” (Jeremiah 23:17).
This means they have no backbone; rather than speak the truth, they speak what they think people want to hear.
Giving false reports—
“Can a man hide himself in hiding places so I do not see him?” declares the Lord. “Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?” declares the Lord. “I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy falsely in My name, saying, ‘I had a dream, I had a dream’” (Jeremiah 23:24-25).
We have an obligation and awesome responsibility to give true reports concerning the Lord. We cannot just present this prophetic stuff as though we know so much more than someone else.
Stealing words from one another—
“‘Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,’ declares the Lord, ‘who steal My words from each other’” (Jer. 23:30).
If our well is dry, it is very easy to succumb to the temptation to take something we learned at a seminar or heard someone say at a meeting and present it as our own, not so much by claiming it as ours, but by not giving credit where credit is due. Saying “I don’t know,” or “I don’t have a word today” is always better than stealing someone else’s word just to save face.
Engaging in reckless boasting—
“Behold, I am against those who have prophesied false dreams,” declares the Lord, “and related them and led My people astray by their falsehoods and reckless boasting; yet I did not send them or command them, nor do they furnish this people the slightest benefit,” declares the Lord” (Jeremiah 23:32).
Let’s not pretend to be better than we are or to embellish our achievements in front of others.
Another danger is making the mistake of following Balaam’s example and allowing ourselves to be bought off for a price (see Num. 22:7; Neh. 13:2; 2 Pet. 2;15.) This again touches on the area of motivation. Why do we do what we do? Hopefully, we do what we do to bring glory, honor, and magnification to Him who is worthy, the Lord Jesus Christ.

Here are a couple of other verses to keep in mind when considering the hindrances of an evil heart:

For the devious are an abomination to the Lord; but He is intimate with the upright (Proverbs 3:32).

You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose: “He jealously desires the Spirit which He has made to dwell in us”? (James 4:4-5)

Another word for devious in Proverbs 3:32 is crooked. To be crooked is to be twisted to some degree. If there is crookedness in our hearts or lives, we cannot be as intimate with the Lord as we would like to be. On the other hand, the Lord is intimate with the upright. This means that He draws near to them and reveals Himself.

On a related theme, James 4:4-5 tells us that we cannot be friends with the world and maintain our friendship with God. The world (unsaved humanity) is an enemy of God, and all who align themselves with the world make themselves God’s enemies as well. Jesus said we cannot serve two masters (see Matt. 6:24). Either the Lord is our master or the world is. There is no other option.

Cultivate the Fear of the Lord
One of the main reasons that so many of us as Christians experience so little of the day-to-day reality and presence of God in our lives is because so few of us truly understand what it means to have a holy fear of the Lord. Fear of the Lord is the basis—the starting place—for building intimacy with God.

God already knows us intimately, and He wants us to know Him the same way. Probably no other passage describes God’s intimate knowledge of us better than Psalms 139:

O Lord, You have searched me and known me. You know when I sit down and when I rise up; You understand my thought from afar. You scrutinize my path and my lying down, and are intimately acquainted with all my ways. Even before there is a word on my tongue, behold, O Lord, You know it all…Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence? If I ascend to heaven, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You are there. If I take the wings of the dawn, if I dwell in the remotest part of the sea, even there Your hand will lead me, and Your right hand will lay hold of me…For You formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother’s womb…Your eyes have seen my unformed substance; and in Your book were all written the days that were ordained for me, when as yet there was not one of them (Psalms 139:1-4,7-10,13,16).

Understanding that God knows us so well should produce the fear of the Lord in our lives; not a frightened fear, but a holy fear of honor, love, and respect for His “God-ness.” God is near us and remote from us at the same time—near because He loves us and pursues a personal love relationship with us, and remote because, as God, He is infinitely greater and higher than we are.

Since God is everywhere at all times, and since His all-seeing eyes know everything about us, why don’t we simply walk in open, transparent honesty with Him? I believe that is really what the fear of the Lord is all about—being open, honest, and transparent with God.

A transparent walk with God will bear in our lives the wonderful fruit of the genuine joy of the Lord.

Arise, shine; for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. For behold, darkness will cover the earth and deep darkness the peoples; but the Lord will rise upon you and His glory will appear upon you. Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising…Then you will see and be radiant, and your heart will thrill and rejoice…” (Isaiah 60:1-3,5a).

Remember what happened to Moses. After being in God’s presence, his face shone so radiantly that he put a veil over his face to shield it. We who are part of the New Covenant in Christ are to reflect the Lord’s brilliance in our lives. When our lives radiate His presence, our hearts will be filled with joy, and that joy will attract others. Basically, Psalms 2:11 says it all: “Worship the Lord with reverence and rejoice with trembling.” The fear of the Lord brings joy.

It also opens the treasury of God. Isaiah 33:6 says, “And He will be the stability of your times, a wealth of salvation, wisdom and knowledge; the fear of the Lord is his treasure.” The psalmist writes:

Who is the man who fears the Lord? He will instruct him in the way he should choose. His soul will abide in prosperity, and his descendants will inherit the land. The secret of the Lord is for those who fear Him, and He will make them know His covenant (Psalms 25:12-14).

A great treasure awaits a covenant people who will walk faithfully in the fear of the Lord: a treasure of abundant salvation, spiritual prosperity, and the passion of life—intimacy with God.

Giving Ourselves to the Process
God is looking for people to share His counsel with. He is looking for people who have a passionate desire for Him. If our passion is for the Lord Himself—not visions or prophecies or manifestations or anything else like that for their own sake—then He will reveal Himself to us in any number of ways. Psalms 37:4 says, “Delight yourself in the Lord; and He will give you the desires of your heart.” If we seek Him, we will find Him. Jesus promised,

Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened (Matthew 7:7-8).

God rewards all who seek Him with their whole heart:

And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him (Hebrews 11:6).

“For I know the plans that I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans for welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope. Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart (Jeremiah 29:11-13).

For many years, while growing up and as a young adult, my wife prayed earnestly for the Lord to come to her. Some years ago, He answered her prayer in a mighty way. Michal Ann entered a period where she received a series of visitations that were so intense, so strong, that she would cry out, “Hold off, Lord, this is too much!” These visitations usually came at night, and during the day, she would pray, “Lord, don’t listen to my prayers at night, but listen to my prayers in the daytime. Oh God, come; oh God, come!”

During one of these encounters, the Lord challenged her: “All your life you have been asking Me to come. Now, do you want Me to come or not?” She answered, “Lord, whether I live or not is not important. If Your presence wants to come so strong that You slay me, then that is Your decision. God, I say this, my God I say, come.”

That is the kind of passion God is looking for. If we will call on the name of the Lord and seek Him with all our hearts, He will show us great and mighty things.

Along with our passionate seeking, we must learn how to balance between the objective and the subjective experience. An objective experience is not determined by impressions, feelings, inner vision or voices, but is based upon convictions concerning God’s character—His faithfulness to keep His promises. A subjective experience, on the other hand, is the cry of the soul for a clearer awareness of God, the passionate desire for a distinct hearing of His voice.

Whatever else we do, we must maintain our balance between the subjective and the objective. We must not become so fixated on prophetic or visionary revelation that we throw away the Bible. Let us keep our objectivity. The revelatory word is not a competitor with the written Word, but a complement to it, and always subordinate to it. The written Word of God is the unwavering standard by which all revelatory word must be measured.

Finally, let God be God! Trust Him to lead safely and securely:

For the Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish (Psalms 1:6).

Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight (Proverbs 3:5-6).

Who is among you that fears the Lord, that obeys the voice of His servant, that walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the name of the Lord and rely on his God (Isaiah 50:10).

Depending on their background and the teaching they have received in their churches, Christians respond to the phenomena of mystical experiences in different ways. Some are suspicious, while others condemn and reject them outright. There are still others, however, who embrace these experiences, sometimes cautiously at first, then with increasing enthusiasm.

Certainly, great care and understanding are necessary when approaching these things and when trying to relate to other believers who may feel differently about them. Carlton Kenney suggests four parameters or guidelines for us to keep in mind with regard to mystical experiences:

We must face up to our prejudices and return to a biblical position concerning mystical experiences. We must not treat them as weird!
We must keep our equilibrium. Mystical experiences are merely a means to an end, not something with which to become overly fascinated.
These experiences are a genuine part of the prophetic ministry. The Lord wants to grant richer encounters to all who seek Him. May all of God’s people be challenged to a more diligent pursuit of God.
Let us provide a friendly climate for emerging prophetic people to mature in their gifting. Now abides faith, hope, and love, these three; the greatest of these is love. Love is the greatest way for gifts to happen and for ministry to mature. If the church will cultivate a loving environment, in a few years the church should really get a prophet’s reward.4
No matter what we do as Christians, our goal—indeed, the goal of all things—should be to grow in intimacy with our loving Father by the power of the Holy Spirit through Jesus Christ our Lord. That is the goal of my life. Want to join me?
