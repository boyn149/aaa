# THE KEY OF INTIMACY TO OPEN HEAVENS 

Jacob was running for his life. His brother Esau was determined to kill him. Why the bad blood between brothers? First, Jacob had tricked Esau into selling his birthright to him for a bowl of stew. Second, Jacob had tricked their father, Isaac, into giving him the blessing that was rightfully Esau’s as the firstborn son. Jacob, whose name means “supplanter,” or “deceiver,” was living up to his name. Cheated twice by his brother, Esau vowed to make Jacob pay for his trickery with his life.

This was the same Jacob who later wrestled with an angel, who many scholars believe was a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ Himself. The Lord lets Jacob think he has won, and in that winning, he obtains God’s blessing. This blessing changes his life, and with that change comes a change of name. Jacob the “deceiver” becomes Israel, the “prince of God.” He departs the wrestling match marked for life by his encounter with a permanent limp, because the angel dislocated his hip. So marked, Israel goes on to become the father of a nation that is to bless the whole earth. Twelve tribes arise from the loins of one man.

The Dream of a Lifetime
All of that was years in the future, however. At that time, Jacob was a young man running scared. Leaving Beersheba in the southern desert of what would one day be the nation of Israel, he traveled toward Haran, the homeland of his mother, Rebekah. Night was falling. Jacob was tired and looked for a place to sleep. He had no idea what was about to happen to him—let alone its eternal impact.

He came to a certain place and spent the night there, because the sun had set; and he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head, and lay down in that place. He had a dream, and behold, a ladder was set on the earth with its top reaching to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. And behold, the Lord stood above it and said, “I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie, I will give it to you and to your descendants. Your descendants will also be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and in you and in your descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed. Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you” (Genesis 28:11-15).

Jacob stopped for the night in a place so rugged that the only thing he could find for a pillow was a stone. Even this was a prophetic symbol: Jacob laid his head upon the rock, and Jesus—Yeshua—is the rock of our salvation. We who know Him are called to be living stones. Jacob laid his head upon the rock and was catapulted into another dimension.

Lying down to sleep, Jacob fell into a dream, but it was no ordinary dream. This dream was of massive proportion and changed his life. Like Jacob, just one night spent with the revelatory presence of God—just one impartation of revelation—can change our lives forever, more than years of learning and personal effort. When God changes our lives, then He can change other people’s lives through us. Such was the case with Jacob.

In Jacob’s dream, he saw a ladder reaching from earth to Heaven, with angels ascending and descending it. What really riveted Jacob’s attention, however, was his vision of the Lord Himself standing at the top of the ladder. Jacob saw right into Heaven—which of us could do such a thing and not be changed? He experienced an open Heaven—such as we looked at in Chapter Eight—in which he saw a visible manifestation of God. One of the main characteristics of an open Heaven is that it opens to our view the activities that are going on in Heaven, and sometimes, even a visual image of the divine Personage.

As Jacob watched in awe (and probably petrified with fear!), the Lord spoke to him, reiterating the promises He had already given to Jacob’s father, Isaac, and grandfather, Abraham. The land on which Jacob then lay was to be his and his descendants’ forever. Here was Jacob, a fugitive and vagabond with perhaps little more than the clothes on his back, yet he was to become the father of a great nation. God assured Jacob that He would be with him wherever he went. When Jacob returned to this land, he would be a man of great wealth and prosperity—but also a man who knew God intimately.

The Gate of Heaven
Needless to say, Jacob was overwhelmed with fear and awe by what he witnessed that night:

Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it.” He was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.” So Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on its top. He called the name of that place Bethel; however, previously the name of the city had been Luz (Genesis 28:16-19).

When Jacob lay down to sleep that night, he did not have the foggiest notion where he really was. His dream changed his entire perspective. What had appeared as nothing more than a dry, rocky, barren waste suddenly became a holy place, the very house of God and gate of Heaven to earth. Jacob walked away from this experience with his senses heightened to the awareness of spiritual realities. Once he saw things from a heavenly point of view, his whole outlook changed.

There is a lesson in this for us. How many of us have looked at our surroundings, the city or town where we live, and seen nothing but a dry desert or a hard and rocky place, as unappealing as yesterday’s leftovers? Too often we curse the place of our assignment because we cannot see it through God’s eyes.

When we moved from the land of the Kansas City Prophets to Nashville, I had a hard time adjusting. I knew the Lord had sent us to a new land of promise, but for the first two years I could just not get it! I walked the floors; I cried out in the night times for answers. I would constantly ask myself and God, “Why is this place called Music City, U.S.A., when on every other street corner there are big brick edifices that are non-instrumental legalistic churches?” At that time, most nationally recognized prophetic voices either avoided Nashville or became encumbered by the “deaf and dumb spirit” that seemed to permeate the buckle of the Bible belt. So I determined to spend time with the Lord to get His understanding. I asked the Holy Spirit to allow me to experience being seated with Christ in the heavenly places to get His perspective.

Eventually I tapped into the “redemptive gift of God”— understanding of my new assignment. The surroundings had not changed (yet). God had not changed His mind. What changed? I changed! As this internal transformation took place, faith lit up on the inside of me to help change Music City into Worship City to the World! Yes, we can have the mind of Christ and believe and act accordingly.

In like manner, Jacob woke up from his dream with a different perspective. What changed? Not his physical environment; he was still surrounded by rocks and barren waste. Heaven had not changed; it was as eternal and changeless as ever. It was Jacob who changed. The open Heaven in his dream allowed him to make the link between Heaven and earth so that he could see his earthly reality from a heavenly perspective. That always changes the way we look at things. “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it.” Perhaps you too need to take some time to sit with Christ Jesus and receive His heavenly view on your present assignment.

Through an open Heaven, Jacob received a moment of revelation that changed his life and his assessment of his situation. Prophetically, he laid his head upon the rock of Jesus, and revelation came down and changed his desert land into Bethel, the “house of God.” For Jacob, an open Heaven was the key to intimacy of knowledge and fellowship with God.

All of us as believers, whether we are church leaders or not, need to get God’s perspective on our present assignments. When we do, our whole outlook, attitude, and perspective will change. Insurmountable obstacles will suddenly become merely challenges to be faced. In faith, we will begin to call that which is not as though it already is. I now love my present assignment. It is one of my greatest privileges that I have been granted. Yes, Music City shall be Worship City to the world!

Jacob called the place where he was “the gate of Heaven.” That is a good description of an open Heaven: a gateway, portal, or doorway into the spiritual realm opens up so that mortals can peer inside. This raises an interesting question: if there were gates of Heaven over specific geographical regions in Jacob’s day, might not the same be true today?

“Behold, the Heavens Were Opened”
The baptism of Jesus was the occasion of another open Heaven event. Although all four Gospels record Jesus’ baptism in one form or another, Matthew provides the most vivid account:

Then Jesus arrived from Galilee at the Jordan coming to John, to be baptized by him. But John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I have need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?” But Jesus answering said to him, “Permit it at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he permitted Him. After being baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and lighting on Him, and behold, a voice out of the heavens said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased” (Matthew 3:13-17).

The wording of this passage indicates that John, as well as Jesus, saw the Heavens open and the Spirit descend as a dove, and he heard the voice from Heaven. This open Heaven experience imparted to John information he would not have known any other way. By his own account, however, John was prepared before the fact, so that when he had this experience he would know what it meant:

The next day [John] saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! This is He on behalf of whom I said, ‘After me comes a Man who has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.’ I did not recognize Him, but so that He might be manifested to Israel, I came baptizing in water.” John testified saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him. I did not recognize Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’ I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God” (John 1:29-34).

John the Baptist saw into a spirit realm and discerned that a sign would be given: the Holy Spirit would not simply come down, but would light upon Jesus or, in John’s words, remain upon Him. The Heavens did open, the Spirit did come down, and the voice of God spoke from Heaven, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased.”

The Spirit descending and remaining was the prophetic sign that enabled John to recognize the Son of God and to know that this man was different from any other man who had ever been born of woman.

So Heavenly Minded
Our desperate need today is to be so hungry for God that we cry out for open Heavens to come over our lives, our families, and our cities. How we need “Jacob’s ladder” to descend again, not just for one night, but permanently! So many of us are famished for the bread of the Spirit; let us call out for Him to come down, not just to alight, but to remain—a manifested habitation of the Lord in our midst!

The depth of our hunger is the length of our reach for God. Just when we start to become satisfied is when God sends us a reminder of how much we still need Him. His desire is to create in us a greater desperation that will stir up a fiercer hunger that will release a longer reach. It isn’t that He is far away, because He is always very near. The issue is our need for open Heavens again. Right here, right now!

I believe we are entering an apostolic era when this whole arena of open Heavens is going to break wide open. There will be teaching, revelation, expression, and experiencing of this on a scale unseen, at least since New Testament days, if ever. Homes, families, congregations, parks, hospitals, city halls—all will become “ground zero” for open Heaven manifestations. I am confident of this because I firmly believe that open Heavens are created over cities. I have experienced this in my own life. Michal Ann and I have experienced it for weeks on end in our home. Therefore, I have faith for this divine realm to be extended over entire regions for protracted periods of time.

From all my years of traveling in many nations, being a part of helping light fires in many places, and interviewing and walking with many “fire starters,” I have learned one very important principle. Before there is ever an open Heaven over a congregation or a city or a nation, there first is an open Heaven over a person.

What kind of people might have Heaven open above them? It would have to be those who became radically undone in the Lord, those who are absolutely “wasted” on Jesus. These are the folks about whom the old saying in the Church speaks: “so heavenly-minded that they are no earthly good.” That statement is not exactly true. In fact, I believe the time has come to modify it to say that visionary people who are radically wasted on Jesus are “so heavenly-minded that they are of immense earthly good.” Whenever Heaven opens over individuals, they carry that open Heaven with them wherever they go and become climate-changers. They become history makers.

God is looking for candidates in this generation who will be seated with Christ in the heavenly places and call forth God’s destiny and design into the earthly realm. It has happened before in all historic awakenings. I am talking about ordinary folks who surrendered to an extraordinary God. I am talking about people like Charles Finney and Evan Roberts.

People of an Open Heaven
Charles Finney, the nineteenth-century evangelist and revivalist, walked under an open Heaven. I don’t know if whole cities were gripped under an open Heaven at one time or not. But this I do know—he carried an open Heaven with him wherever he went. The anointing on his life was so strong that he would walk into a factory and before he could say a word, people would start weeping and coming under strong conviction of sin. Men, women, boys, and girls repented of their sins and turned to Jesus left and right. Finney had his critics, but he also had astonishing results. People who came into Finney’s presence came under an open Heaven, and many, many of them were changed forever. Some people claim that this phenomenon is not biblical. On the contrary, it is very biblical. It is called “presence evangelism.” It is being a carrier of His infectious presence.

Methods change, audiences change, culture and social mores change, but human nature does not. All humans are alike in that they share a common sinful nature. For this reason, the Gospel message must never change. No matter how we might alter our approach or tailor our methods in reaching people for Christ, one thing that must never change is our message. The Word of God is the “old, old story,” and it is awesome and completely sufficient. There is no deeper truth than Jesus Christ crucified, risen from the dead, and returning one day to claim His Bride, the Church. Let’s keep the main thing the main thing.

Evan Roberts was a young Welshman of 26 when Heaven opened above him, and he began to walk under a powerful anointing. The great revival that came to Wales in the early years of the twentieth-century did not begin with an open Heaven over a church or over a village or over a city. It began with one young man who was obedient to follow God’s call on his life and who hungered for the moving of God’s Spirit in power. Eventually, everywhere Evan Roberts went, the open Heaven followed.

His meetings were not typical for those times. They were more akin to what we would call worship and prayer meetings or, as it is often called today, “harp and bowl” gatherings. In a very real sense, the Welsh revival was a worship revival. Great singing abounded. The Welsh people have a rich and abundant hymn-singing tradition. Great hymns and other worship songs grew out of this world-impacting revival.

Intercessory prayer was a central focus to Roberts’ meetings. In a typical gathering, he would have the first person stand and pray, “Send the Spirit now for Jesus Christ’s sake.” That person would sit down and the next person would stand and pray the same prayer: “Send the Spirit now for Jesus’ sake.” Roberts would go from one person to the next, and each would stand and pray the same way. Even people who had never prayed publicly stood and called to the Lord to send His Spirit now!

If the Spirit had not manifested His presence by the time the first row had finished praying, Roberts went on to the second row. After everyone had prayed, if the Spirit still had not come with conviction and power and manifested presence—if the “glory realm” of God had not showed up yet—Roberts simply started over. The second time around, however, he gave the people a second prayer. This time, when they stood up to pray they said, “Send the Spirit now, more powerfully for Jesus Christ’s sake.”

It was a simple, yet highly anointed approach, and God answered in a mighty way because Heaven was open over this young man. Those who came near caught the blessings. History was changed. The spiritual climate went from cold to hot.

Not long before the Welsh revival broke out, Evan Roberts spent several months at a Bible school in northern Wales, where he heard a young evangelist named Seth Joshua. At one point, Seth Joshua prayed, “Lord, bend the Church to save the world.” When Evan Roberts heard that prayer, an arrow from God pierced his heart and gave him a burden for Wales and for the world.

Intimacy with God is the key to open Heavens. “Lord, bend the Church!” We possess the potential for earth-shaking revival, yet at the same time we are the biggest obstacles to it. “Lord, bend the Church! Bend the Church in a region. Bend the Church to save the world. Bend us, Lord!” We cannot allow ourselves to become resistant to God.

Once we see Him—once He really reveals Himself to us—we will be completely undone. When we see the One who is standing at the top of the ladder, we will be radically, totally wasted for Him! That is my goal—to see Him, to know Him, to become like Him; to become a gate for the sake of others.

Omnipresence vs. Manifest Presence
In his inspiring book The Secret of the Stairs, author Wade Taylor identifies the differences between the omnipresence and manifest presence of the Lord:

Many are not able to differentiate between these two aspects of His presence. First, there is His “omni-presence,” which fills heaven and earth, and relates to our salvation and to its outworking within our lives. This speaks of the unconditional, “abiding presence,” of the Holy Spirit within us.

Second, there is the coming of the Lord to us as a Person, having intellect, will, and emotions. The Lord is eager to come within our chamber, to personally “share Himself with us” in fellowship, and then lead us upward into His chambers, where “we share with Him” in the outworking of His purposes. This speaks of a “conditional” visitation from the Lord to us, and is referred to as His “manifest presence.”

The first aspect of His presence is general, and relates to His redemptive grace. “Do not I fill heaven and earth? says the Lord.” (Jer. 23:24b.) The second aspect of His presence is specific, and relates to His person. “He stands behind our wall, He looks forth at the windows, showing Himself through the lattice.” (Song of Sol. 2:9b.)

Jesus expresses the conditions that allow Him to personally manifest Himself to us in the Gospel of John. “He that has My commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves Me: and he that loves Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him. Judas says to Him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that You will manifest Yourself to us, and not to the world? Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love Me, he will keep My words: and My Father will love him, and We will come to him, and make Our abode with him.” (John 14:21-23).1

At the Age of Seven
When our oldest son, Justin, was but seven years old, he had a profound encounter with God. He was asleep in the top bunk, and his younger brother, Tyler, around three years old at the time, was asleep on the bottom bunk. Suddenly Justin was awakened. His eyes were opened in the Spirit, and he saw clouds fill his room. The throne of God was in the midst of the clouds with four unusual creatures surrounding it. A ladder unfurled from Heaven down into his room and one angel at a time would descend into his room carrying fire in its hand. The angel would release the fire and then ascend back up the ladder, only for several others to follow suit.

Finally one last angel descended into his room carrying a letter in its hand. The angel placed the letter on his dresser and then ascended up the ladder into the clouds of Heaven. Justin then watched as the clouds enveloped the throne and everything disappeared from his natural and spiritual sight. One thing remained in view though. The stationery on his dresser was left for a seven-year-old to read. He stared at the letter left for him from Heaven. It read, “Pray for your dad.”

Angelic ambassadors sent a message to a seven-year-old boy, inviting him to participate in God’s agenda. Heaven wanted Justin’s prayers. The Lord knew his dear dad needed some reinvigorating, as I was involved in an assignment of major intercessory proportions in another city. Heaven is waiting for your prayers, too. Invitations are still being sent out. Will you be there to answer?

A Door in Heaven
John the Beloved received an open Heaven through which he saw the Lord. His experience came near the end of a long life of faithful and obedient service to Christ and His Church. Listen to his description:

After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, like the sound of a trumpet speaking with me, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things.” Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was standing in heaven, and One sitting on the throne. And He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance (Revelation 4:1-3).

Jacob saw One standing at the top of the ladder; John saw One sitting on the throne. This John—John the Beloved—is the same John who laid his head upon the chest of Yeshua the Messiah at the Last Supper; who heard the very pounding of the heartbeat of God; who heard the very breath of the Master, both in the natural and in the spirit realm as the pneuma or wind of the Holy Spirit. This John is the one known as “the disciple whom Jesus loved.” John the Beloved is the only disciple mentioned by name who stayed with Jesus even to the Cross, after all the others had fled.

Why did John stay at the Cross? I wonder if intimacy had something to do with his endurance and staying the course. Hearing the very heartbeat of God “ruined” John for life. He could never be the same again after catching the rhythm of that divine heart. Before long, John’s heart began beating in union with the heart of God Himself, and now two hearts were beating in unison together. They were in agreement. This agreement, the coming together of the divine and human spirits in unison in an earthen vessel, is what is called in the old mystical Christian writings, greater union with Christ.

Many believers are just after intimacy, while many others are after souls. It is not an either/or proposition. There is a bridge between them both, a “leakage” between open Heavens. A powerful vision of the Almighty produces a passion for reaching souls. Intimacy eventually leads to evangelism.

Open the Door
In Revelation 4:1 John says, “After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven.” After what things? Since the division of the Bible into chapters and verses was made long after it was written, it is only logical to look in the previous chapter to see what John was referring to.

Chapter one of Revelation relates John’s initial vision of the Lord that he saw while “in the Spirit” on the Lord’s day. Chapters two and three contain messages from the Lord to seven churches in Asia Minor: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. The messages reveal the spiritual condition of each church, good or bad. Laodicea, the seventh church, is described as “lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold” (Rev. 3:16), and the Lord threatens to spit them from His mouth. Just four verses later, however, He gives a glorious promise to those who will listen and obey:

Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me (Revelation 3:20).

Whose door is Jesus standing before? This is a prophetic apostolic message, a heavenly message sent to a church in a city. It is not a word written just to an individual. Certainly, the invitation Jesus gives here applies to individuals, so it is quite appropriate to use this verse in evangelism as is so often done. Contextually, however, the word is for a group, a corporate body. Revelation 3:20 is an apostolic word about the voice of the Holy Spirit standing in front of a city. It is a city-transformation word where Jesus says in effect, “I am standing at the door of Laodicea.” Many biblical scholars believe that our current age of the Church is the Laodicean age, characterized widely by lukewarm attitudes among churches and individual believers.

If we want open doors and open Heavens, then we have to do what precedes—what comes first. If we want the door to open in Heaven, we have to open the door to Jesus’ knock on earth. Earthen vessels must answer the persistent, loving knock of God. As we respond, God responds. Intimacy with Him is the key that opens the door of Heaven. It begins with each of us as individuals—remember that an open Heaven comes first over a person—but the Lord’s goal goes beyond individuals. He is after cities and nations.

Jesus says, “Behold I stand at the door of a whole city and knock. Is there anyone, a corporate Body of Christ in this region, that will open the door to Me, and let Me in? Are there gatekeepers in this region who are so desperate that they don’t care what house gets built, as long as it is God’s house?”

Sometimes the simple truths are the most easily overlooked. We use this verse for individual salvation, and rightfully so; but in context, it is an apostolic invitation for citywide transformation. Jesus stands at the doors of our cities and our churches, knocking. He is a persistent and loving Lord who will keep on knocking. Who will answer? If the people behind one door say no, He will go to another door, and another door, and another. He will keep knocking on doors until someone opens up and lets Him come in. He wants to come in and fellowship with His people. Too often we treat Him like He is a guest! But He is the owner of the House! He wants to come in for more than just a good meeting—He wants to dwell among His people!

Just don’t be surprised when He ends up invading a place no one expects. Some hungry soul behind that door is crying, “Oh Lord, oh Lord, send Your Spirit now, for Jesus Christ’s sake. Send your Spirit, Lord, powerfully, for Jesus Christ’s sake.”

His promise is for everyone—individuals, families, and communities. It is a city-transformation promise. “Open the door,” Jesus says, “and I will come in to you and will dine with you and you with Me.” He says, “Open the door, and I will sit down at your table and eat with you. This is not just a quick visit. I am here to stay.”

What Do You Hear?
Does anybody hear the knock? Jesus is knocking, knocking, knocking. He comes to cities and knocks; many of them just say, “Go on somewhere else,” and they miss the day of their visitation. He goes to the next city, and the next, looking for individuals hungry to be part of a prophetic revolution and an apostolic reformation. He is looking for gatekeepers of His presence—those prophets and seers and passionate Jesus-lovers who will say, “Oh Jesus, whatever you do, don’t pass us by!”

Intimacy is the key that unlocks open Heavens over entire cities. It has happened before, and it can happen again. I firmly believe that it will happen again. Jesus did not stop knocking after Revelation 3:20 was written. He has been knocking for 2,000-plus years. Today, He stands at the doors of twenty-first-century cities, asking, “Who will answer?”

He stood at the door of a small nation called Wales, and somebody answered. He stood at the door of cosmopolitan Los Angeles, and somebody answered. He stood at the door of tiny Hebrides Islands, and somebody answered. He stood at the door of Shantung, China, and somebody answered. Jesus is knocking again, patiently knocking. I put the question to you: how will you respond to the Man who is knocking at your city’s door? “Behold I stand at the door and knock. Is there anyone…are there any gatekeepers who will let Me in?” Do you hear what I hear?

What will you do? Will you ignore the knock until He goes away? Or will you open the door and say, like Joshua, “As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord”? “For the sake of the city we represent, we will open the door to You. Come in, sit with us, eat with us, and fellowship with us. Let the Heavens open over this place, this home, this city, and let the blessings and power of our loving Father pour forth to bless the people!” So be it, Lord!

The Purpose of the Seer
So what is the purpose of the seer? Like all true seers of old, we must reach high. We must look heavenward. We must think otherly. We must passionately pursue the God of visitation. John the Beloved said it this way, as recorded in Revelation 1:9-17:

I, John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance which are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos, because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet…Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands; and in the middle of the lampstands I saw one like a son of man, clothed in a robe reaching to the feet, and girded across His chest with a golden sash. His head and His hair were white like white wool, like snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire. His feet were like burnished bronze, when it has been made to glow in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters. In His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was like the sun shining in its strength. When I saw Him, I fell at His feet… (Revelation 1:9-17a).

If there are true seers in the earth today, and there surely are, then we must have our aim and focus clear. We must see Jesus! In all our seeing, let’s be like John the Beloved. Let’s get in the Spirit and release the true prophetic spirit by revealing a testimony of Jesus (see Rev. 19:10). He is the One I long to see. He is the One for whom my heart yearns and pants. He is the goal and prize of my life.

May the key of intimacy be put in the door of our hearts, families, congregations, cities, and nations. May the prophetic power of visions, dreams, and open Heavens increase. May you receive an impartation of hunger for more of the Lord and may you increase in your spiritual capacity to “see in the Spirit realm.” But always remember, the seer’s goal is to reveal the Man Christ Jesus!

Oh, that we might see Jesus more clearly!
