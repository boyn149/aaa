The text contrasts and compares the **nabiy’ prophetic stream** and the **ra’ah/chozeh seer stream** to highlight their unique characteristics and how they complement each other. Here's a detailed breakdown:

*   **Nabiy’ Prophetic Anointing:**
    *   Tends towards the **audible and verbal**, emphasizing communication.
    *   Often operates within a **plurality of leadership**, where seasoned individuals minister through the laying on of hands, relating prophecy to individuals or the group.
    *   Utilizes spiritual gifts such as **tongues, interpretation of tongues, prophecy, and words of knowledge**.
    *   Characterized by **spontaneity and a faster flow**, with inspiration as the general tone.
    *   Prophets in this stream "hear" a word in their spirits and then release that word.

*   **Ra’ah/Chozeh Seer Anointing:**
    *   Tends more toward **single-person ministry**.
    *   Emphasizes **visions and revelatory gifts** mixed with the gift of **discerning of spirits** rather than audible speaking gifts.
    *   Operates at a **slower pace** due to the seer describing supernatural pictures in their own words.
    *   Often **receives information ahead of time** to share later.
    *   Can be dependent on **angelic visitations and the manifested presence of God**.
    *   May have limitations until they sense the anointing.

*  **Two Levels of "Seeing" within the Seer Anointing:**
    *   **Visual "seeing"**: Involves insights, revelations, warnings, and prophecies from the Spirit of God that may come in supernatural visual dreams where the spirit observes and receives the message. Open heaven visions, where higher celestial realms are disclosed, are often a part of this type of seeing.
    *   **Actual "seeing"**: Involves supernatural dreams in which God’s tangible presence is evident or manifested.

*   **Contrasting the Two Streams:**
    *   The *nabiy’* prophetic stream is often **spontaneous** and activated by faith, while the *ra’ah/chozeh* stream is **more dependent on the manifested presence of God**.
    *   *Nabiy’* prophets often **speak** what they hear in their spirits, while *ra’ah/chozeh* seers **describe** what they see in visions or dreams.
    *   *Nabiy’* prophecy is generally **faster** and more inspirational in its flow, while *ra’ah/chozeh* prophecy often involves a **slower, more descriptive** process.

*   **Similarities and Complementary Nature:**
    *   Both are **valid ministries** and **needed in the Church**.
    *   Both are considered legitimate expressions of God's prophetic stream.
    *   Both have the same goal: **to speak what God has given** them in order to exhort, edify, and comfort the Body of Christ.
    *   Both represent diversities in the prophetic anointing.
    *   All prophecy comes from the same source: God the Father, through Jesus Christ, by the present-day ministry of the Holy Spirit.

*   **Overall Purpose:**
    *   The purpose of both is to **reveal the wonders of Jesus Christ** and God's purpose in each generation and to bring an awareness of eternity, Heaven, and hell, and the Father's great presence among His people.
    * This can be done through audible or visual means, and through spontaneous inspiration or reflective contemplation.

In summary, while the *nabiy’* prophetic stream is characterized by its audible and verbal nature, often working in a group and with spontaneous inspiration, the *ra’ah/chozeh* seer stream is more visually oriented, often working individually and dependent on the manifested presence of God. Both, however, are crucial in bringing out the fullest expression of God's prophetic revelation in the Church. They are different but complementary expressions of the same prophetic anointing.
