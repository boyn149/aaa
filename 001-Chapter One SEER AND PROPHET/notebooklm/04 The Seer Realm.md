The text delves into the distinctive realm of the seer within the broader prophetic landscape, emphasizing that **all true seers are prophets, but not all prophets are seers**. Here's a detailed explanation of the seer realm:

*   **Definition of a Seer:**
    *   A seer is a particular type of prophet who receives a specific type of prophetic revelation or impartation.
    *   The Old Testament primarily uses two words to refer to a seer: **ra'ah** and **chozeh**.
        *   **Ra'ah** literally means "to see," particularly in the sense of seeing visions. It also includes meanings like "to gaze," "to look upon," and "to perceive".
        *   **Chozeh** literally means "a beholder in vision" and can be translated as "gazer" or "stargazer".
*   **Distinction Between Prophet (Nabiy’) and Seer (Ra'ah or Chozeh):**
    *   A **prophet** is primarily an **inspired hearer and speaker**. They are the communicative dimension, actively speaking forth a message from God.
    *   A **seer** is primarily **visual and receptive**. They focus on the experience or means by which the prophet "sees or perceives" the message.
    *   The emphasis for a prophet is on their relationship with the people, while for a seer, it's on their revelatory relationship with God.
*   **Seers in Ancient Israel:**
    *   Seers were often employed in the royal court to offer counsel to the king.
    *   Examples include Asaph and Gad, who were both seers in King David’s court.
    *   Nathan also served King David, but was called a prophet.
    *   Gad was referred to as both a prophet and a seer.
    *   Prophets and seers were both considered spokespeople for God.
*   **Characteristics of the Seer Realm:**
    *   Seers generally see visions regularly.
    *   Their prophetic anointing is often **more visionary than auditory**.
    *   Instead of receiving words to repeat, they often **see pictures that they then describe**, in the form of waking visions or dreams.
    *   While a *nabiy’* prophet's word is often spontaneous and activated by faith, a *ra’ah* or *chozeh* seer’s is **more dependent on the manifested presence of God**.
    *   Seers often receive information ahead of time to share later, and they may look for confirmation of what they have seen in the natural.
    *   Impartation in the seer realm often comes after a period of waiting on God.
    *   Seers may be dependent on angelic visitations and the manifested presence of God.
*   **Two Levels of "Seeing":**
    *   **Visual "seeing"** involves insights, revelations, warnings, and prophecies from the Spirit of God that may come in supernatural visual dreams. In this, a person observes and receives the message. Open heaven visions are often part of this kind of seeing, where higher celestial realms are disclosed.
    *   **Actual "seeing"** involves supernatural dreams in which God's tangible presence is evident or manifested.
*   **Differences Between Prophets and Seers:**
    *   *Nabiy’* prophets tend to operate in a plurality of leadership with a more audible and verbal style. They often use spiritual gifts of tongues, interpretation of tongues, prophecy, and words of knowledge. They tend to be more spontaneous and inspirational.
    *   *Ra’ah* or *chozeh* seers tend to operate more in a single-person ministry emphasizing visions, revelatory gifts and discerning of spirits rather than audible speaking gifts. They often operate at a slower pace because they describe supernatural pictures in their own words.
*   **The Value of Both Streams:**
    *   Both prophets and seers are equally valid and needed in the Church today.
    *   They both serve the same Lord and share the same goal of speaking what God has given them to edify, exhort, and comfort the Body of Christ.
    *   Both are legitimate expressions of God's prophetic stream.

In summary, the seer realm is a distinct aspect of the prophetic, characterized by visual revelation, dependence on the manifested presence of God, and often operating at a different pace than the more audible and spontaneous nabiy’ prophet.
