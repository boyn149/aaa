The text explains that the prophetic word is imparted by God through the Holy Spirit in a variety of ways. Here's a breakdown of the different modes of impartation:

*   **Nataf:** This Hebrew word, according to Strong's Concordance, means "to let drop like rain".
    *   It describes a **slow, gentle process** where the prophetic word comes gradually and accumulates in a person's spirit over time.
    *   It's likened to a mist of God descending, slowly permeating the spirit, or a sponge gradually soaking up "raindrops" of the prophetic presence until it overflows.
*   **Massa:** This word refers to the "hand of the Lord" that releases the "burden of the Lord".
    *   When God's hand comes upon someone, **He imparts something - a prophetic "burden"**.
    *   Even after God's hand lifts, the burden remains, as a word or commission from Him, which may be carried for extended periods of time.
    *  This "burden" can be for a particular situation and can come with supernatural enablement of grace to prophesy and intercede.
*   **Nabiy':** As previously defined, this term describes the action of "**flowing forth**," or "**bubbling forth like a fountain**".
    *   It perfectly describes the **inspirational gift of prophecy** often seen in meetings, especially within a group of elders or gifted individuals working together as a "prophetic presbytery".

These modes of impartation demonstrate the different ways in which God communicates His prophetic word, each with its unique characteristics and impact. All prophecy comes from God through the Holy Spirit, but it operates differently in different people.
