The text discusses the re-emergence of two distinct prophetic streams in recent years, which initially appeared over 50 years ago: the **seer visionary stream** and the **nabiy’ verbal stream**. Here's a breakdown of these streams and their historical context:

*   **Historical Emergence:**
    *   These two streams of restoration came forth in 1947-48.
    *   The **Latter Rain Movement** emphasized the laying on of hands and extensive congregational prophesying. It also emphasized moving into the prophetic realm by faith, grace, and gifting.
    *   The **Healing and Deliverance Movement** emphasized laying on of hands for healing, deliverance, and world evangelism by preaching with signs and wonders.
    *   Both movements were considered valid ministries from God.
    *   David Shoch was a father figure in the Latter Rain Movement, while William Branham was a leader in the Healing and Deliverance Movement.
    *   One was a *nabiy’* prophet, and the other was a *chozeh* seer.

*   **Re-emergence:**
    *   These streams waned in the early 1950s but have **re-emerged over the past 20 years or so**.
    *   The modern prophetic movement in America appeared in the late 1980s, particularly in Kansas City, Missouri, at the Kansas City Fellowship (later Metro Vineyard Fellowship, then Metro Christian Fellowship, and today IHOP-KC).
    *   Key figures in this movement included Mike Bickle, Bob Jones, John Paul Jackson, and Paul Cain.

*   **Core Convictions of the Modern Prophetic Movement:**
    *   The prophetic gift should be restored in the Church.
    *   Prophecy is a natural, biblical means for God to speak to His people.
    *   Increased prophetic activity is a sign of the emergence of the last-days victorious Church.

*   **Characteristics of the Modern Prophetic Movement:**
    *   Modern-day prophecy consists of three parts: **revelation, interpretation, and application**.
    *   There is a recognized danger of human instruments misconstruing interpretation or application.
    *   The movement has grown to encompass multiple streams and locations and has matured over time.

*  **Key Figures in the Modern Prophetic Movement:**
    *   **Bob Jones** had an angelic visitation in his youth and was commissioned by the Lord after a near-death experience to anoint leaders for the end-time harvest.
    *   **Paul Cain** was born to a mother who was miraculously healed and had a traveling ministry in the 1950s, later experiencing a period of retreat and then restoration.
*  **Current State:**
    *  The Christian Church is experiencing its greatest period of prophetic impartation since the first century.
    *  The prophetic river is widening, deepening, and growing.

In summary, the text describes the resurgence of two distinct prophetic streams, the seer visionary and nabiy' verbal, which originated in the mid-20th century and have re-emerged in recent decades, significantly influencing the modern prophetic movement with core convictions and key figures such as Bob Jones and Paul Cain.
