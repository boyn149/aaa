*   **Definition of Prophecy:**
    *   Prophecy is described as a **supernatural utterance in a known language**.
    *   The Hebrew word for "to prophesy" implies "to flow forth," "to bubble forth like a fountain," or "to spring forth".
    *   The Greek word means "to speak for another," specifically to speak for God or to be His spokesman.
    *   Prophecy is understood as **speaking under the direct supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit**, becoming God's mouthpiece. It is also described as speaking forth the mind and counsel of God, inseparable from the direct inspiration of the Spirit.
    *   Prophecy is considered **the very voice of Christ speaking in the church**.
    *   It is the supernaturally imparted ability to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit and speak God's mind or counsel.
    *   Prophecy is the communication of an immediate message of God through a divinely anointed utterance.
    *   It is the expressed thoughts of God spoken in a language that no person could articulate on their own. The nature of prophecy exceeds the limits of the human mind.
    *   Prophecy's purpose is to **edify, exhort, and comfort** individuals or the corporate body of Christ. It overcomes condemnation and discouragement.

*   **The Role of a Prophet:**
    *   A prophet is a **spokesperson for God**, who hears the voice of the Holy Spirit and speaks or pens Godâ€™s mind in a divinely anointed manner.
    *   The Hebrew word *nabiy'* for prophet relates to hearing and speaking, being a "mouthpiece" for God.

    *   The prophetic word is imparted in different ways, described using Hebrew terms:
        *   *Nataf* describes a gradual process where the prophetic word slowly permeates one's spirit like rain.
        *   *Massa* refers to the "burden of the Lord" imparted when God's hand comes upon a person, leaving a prophetic commission.
        *    *Nabiy'* refers to the action of "flowing forth" or "bubbling forth like a fountain", describing the inspirational gift of prophecy.
    *   The prophetic word is expressed through people, but it originates from the mind of God.
    *   Prophets declare the word that God has given to them.

In summary, prophecy is a supernatural act of speaking for God, characterized by divine inspiration and the communication of God's thoughts and counsel. A prophet is someone who acts as God's spokesperson, declaring His word through a divinely anointed manner.
