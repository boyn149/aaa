Chapter one of the provided text introduces the concepts of **prophets** and **seers** as two distinct streams of prophetic anointing that come together to form a greater prophetic river. The chapter emphasizes that both streams are crucial for the full expression of God's prophetic word.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts discussed:

*   **The Nile River Analogy:** The chapter uses the Nile River as an analogy, with the White Nile and the Blue Nile representing the streams of the prophet and the seer, respectively. These two rivers join to create the Egyptian Nile, symbolizing the combined power of both prophetic streams.
*   **Prophecy Defined:** The text provides several definitions of prophecy, highlighting that it is a supernatural utterance in a known tongue and involves speaking for God or being His mouthpiece. It is described as the voice of Christ speaking in the Church, with the purposes of edification, exhortation, and comfort. Prophecy is understood to be the expressed thoughts of God, exceeding human capabilities and coming through people but originating from God's mind.
*   **The Prophet (Nabiy’):** A prophet is defined as a spokesperson for God who hears the voice of the Holy Spirit and speaks or pens God's mind in a divinely anointed manner. The Hebrew word *nabiy’* emphasizes hearing and speaking, and being a mouthpiece for God. Biblical examples of prophets include Abraham, Moses, Aaron, Jeremiah, and John the Baptist. Prophets declare the word that God has given them.
*   **Ways of Prophetic Impartation:** The text describes several ways God imparts prophetic words, using Hebrew terms from Strong's Concordance:
    *   **Nataf:** The prophetic word comes gradually, like rain, slowly permeating one's spirit.
    *   **Massa:** The "hand of the Lord" imparts a "burden of the Lord," a prophetic commission that one carries even after the hand lifts.
    *  **Nabiy':** The action of "flowing forth" or "bubbling forth like a fountain" particularly in a team setting.
*   **The Seer (Ra'ah and Chozeh):** A seer is a specific type of prophet who primarily receives visual prophetic revelation. The Hebrew words *ra'ah* and *chozeh* mean "to see" or "a beholder in vision". Seers are more visual and receptive, while prophets (nabiy’) are more communicative and emphasize speaking forth God's message. Seers are also described as having a revelatory relationship with God, while prophets are more concerned with the people.
*   **Seers in the Royal Court:** Seers were often employed in royal courts to counsel kings, like Asaph and Gad in King David’s court. In contrast, Nathan was called a prophet.
*   **Prophets and Seers Compared:** All true seers are prophets, but not all prophets are seers. Prophets (nabiy’) tend to be more audible and verbal, while seers (ra'ah and chozeh) are more visual. Seers may see pictures, visions or dreams, and their prophetic anointing is more dependent on the manifested presence of God. Nabiy' prophets are often spontaneous, while seers may receive information ahead of time.
*   **Latter-Day Prophetic Streams:** The chapter discusses the re-emergence of the seer visionary stream and the nabiy’ verbal stream in recent years, with figures like Bob Jones representing the seer stream and Bishop Bill Hamon the nabiy’ stream. These streams emerged in the mid-20th century and have re-emerged more recently. The modern prophetic movement in America appeared in the late 1980s in Kansas City with key figures such as Bob Jones and Paul Cain.
*  **Modern Prophecy:** Modern-day prophecy in the Church includes revelation, interpretation and application. There is an important need for caution as there can be errors in both interpretation and application.
*   **Two levels of "seeing"**: Visual "seeing" involves insights and revelations from God in dreams. Actual "seeing" involves dreams with God's tangible presence.
*   **The Importance of Both Streams:** Both prophets and seers are needed in the Church today. They serve the same Lord and have the same goal: to speak what God has given them to edify, exhort, and comfort the Body of Christ. Both streams come from God, and the goal is to reveal the wonders of Jesus Christ.
*   **Praying for Vision:** The chapter encourages praying for the seer anointing using Paul’s prayer in Ephesians 1:17-21 and Elisha's prayer in 2 Kings 6:15-17, asking for enlightened hearts and the ability to see into the spiritual realm. It also expresses the belief that any believer can develop the seer capacity.

The chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding and appreciating both the prophet and seer streams, as they contribute to the great river of God's prophetic movement.
