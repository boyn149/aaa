# SEER AND PROPHET 

The Nile is truly one of the great rivers of the world. Including its tributaries, the Nile is also the longest river in the world, running over 4,100 miles from its beginning in the heart of the African continent to its mouth in Egypt, where it flows into the Mediterranean Sea. For thousands of years, the waters of the Nile have sustained the lives of those who dwell along its banks and on its flood plain. Few other rivers have been as vital to the rise or fall of human culture and civilization along their banks as has the Nile.

As mighty as the Nile is, however, it begins its life as two rivers, rather than one. The White Nile flows from Lake Victoria in Tanzania, and the Blue Nile from Lake Tana in Ethiopia. These two watercourses come together in Khartoum, in the Sudan, to form the Egyptian Nile, which then runs over 1,600 miles northward on its way to the sea. Two separate streams, each strong and significant in its own right, join together, with each adding its strength to the other to form one mighty river that nurtures and sustains life along its entire course.

In the spiritual realm, the flow of the prophetic from Heaven to earth resembles the Nile River. Just as the White Nile and the Blue Nile join to create the greater river called the Egyptian Nile, two streams of prophetic anointing come together to feed the greater concourse of the mighty prophetic river of God on earth. We can call these two streams the stream of the prophet and the stream of the seer.

Another way to look at this, as I mentioned in the introduction to this section, is to turn it around and think of a great prophetic river flowing from the throne of God that breaks into two streams—the prophet and the seer—which then give different degrees or dimensions or facets of prophetic impartation. Either way, it should be clear that both streams are important for the full expression of the Lord’s prophetic word to His people in our day.

Prophecy and Prophet Defined
In order to understand the difference between the prophet and the seer better, we need to define some foundational terms. Many Christians today are confused about the prophetic—what it is and how it operates. First of all, then, what do we mean by the word prophecy?

Kenneth Hagin, the late father of the modern faith movement, stated:

Prophecy is supernatural utterance in a known tongue. The Hebrew word “to prophesy” means “to flow forth.” It also carries with it the thought “to bubble forth like a fountain, to let drop, to lift up, to tumble forth, and to spring forth.” The Greek word that is translated “prophesy” means “to speak for another.” It means to speak for God or to be His spokesman.1

According to Dick Iverson, former senior pastor of Bible Temple in Portland, Oregon:

The gift of prophecy is speaking under the direct supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit. It is becoming God’s mouthpiece, to verbalize His words as the Spirit directs. The Greek word propheteia means “speaking forth the mind and counsel of God.” It is inseparable in its New Testament usage with the concept of direct inspiration of the Spirit. Prophecy is the very voice of Christ speaking in the church.2

Iverson’s last statement is one of the best definitions of prophecy I have ever heard: prophecy is the very voice of Christ speaking in the Church!

The late international Bible teacher Derek Prince, the spiritual father who impacted my life more than any other leader, defined prophecy in the following way:

The gift of prophecy is the supernaturally imparted ability to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit and speak God’s mind or counsel. Prophecy ministers not only to the assembled group of believers, but also to individuals. Its three main purposes are:

To edify = to build up, strengthen, to make more effective.

To exhort = to stimulate, to encourage, to admonish.

To comfort = to cheer up.

Thus prophecy overcomes two of satan’s most common attacks: condemnation and discouragement.3

David Pytches, a respected author and former Spirit-filled Anglican bishop, says:

The gift of prophecy is the special ability that God gives to members of the body of Christ to receive and to communicate an immediate message of God to His gathered people, a group among them, or any one of His people individually, through a divinely anointed utterance.4

I assimilate all these understandings by stating that prophecy means the expressed thoughts of God spoken in a language that no people, in their natural gifts of speech, could articulate on their own. The substance and nature of prophecy exceed the limits that the human mind is capable of thinking or imagining. Its purpose is to edify, exhort, and comfort either individuals or the corporate Body of Christ. Although prophecy comes through the mouth or pen of people, it comes from the mind of God.

A prophet or prophetess then, is a spokesperson for God, one who hears the voice of the Holy Spirit and speaks or pens God’s mind or counsel through a “divinely anointed manner.”

The word prophet appears more than 300 times in the Old Testament and more than 100 times in the New Testament. In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word used most often for “prophet” is the word nabiy’ (nahbi). Here are a few examples.

According to Genesis, Abraham was a prophet:

Now therefore, restore the man’s [Abraham’s] wife, for he is a prophet [nabiy’], and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours (Genesis 20:7).

The same was said about Moses:

Since that time no prophet [nabiy’] has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face (Deuteronomy 34:10).

As spokesman for his brother, Aaron was also a prophet:

Then the Lord said to Moses, “See, I make you as God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet” [nabiy’] (Exodus 7:1).

God called Jeremiah as a prophet even before he was born:

Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I have appointed you a prophet [nabiy’] to the nations (Jeremiah 1:5).

Malachi spoke of a prophet who would appear in the last days:

Behold, I am going to send you Elijah the prophet [nabiy’] before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord (Malachi 4:5).

From Jesus’ own words in Matthew 11:14, we know that this Scripture in Malachi refers to John the Baptist.

In a verse that many people believe refers to Jesus, the Messiah, God promised to raise up another prophet as a spiritual successor to Moses:

I will raise up a prophet [nabiy’] from among their countrymen like you, and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him (Deuteronomy 18:18).

The word nabiy’ has to do with hearing and speaking, with being a “mouthpiece” for God, declaring that which one has heard. A nabiy’ prophet is a person who speaks on behalf of a superior. In Aaron’s case, this was Moses and, ultimately, God. In the case of every biblical prophet, in fact, God was the superior for whom they spoke. Their words originated with Him. He planted His word in their hearts and mouths, and they in turn declared it to the people. In short, nabiy’ prophets are speakers who declare the word that God has given to them.

Imparting the Prophetic
God imparts this prophetic word in a number of ways. All prophecy comes from God through the Holy Spirit, but it operates differently in different people. The Old Testament uses several different Hebrew terms to describe the various modes of impartation.

First, according to Strong’s Concordance, there is nataf, which means “to let drop like rain.” This describes a slow, gentle process where the prophetic word comes upon us little by little and accumulates in our spirits over a period of time. It is like being in a certain place and having the mist of God descend around us and slowly permeate our spirits. Some have described it as being like a sponge that gradually soaks up and absorbs the “raindrops” of the prophetic presence of the Lord until they fill up and overflow.

The second Hebrew word listed in Strong’s Concordance for prophetic impartation is massa, which refers to the “hand of the Lord” that releases the “burden of the Lord.” When God’s hand comes upon us, He imparts something to us—a prophetic “burden”—and when His hand lifts, that burden remains. The Lord deposits something in our spirits that was not there before; and even after He lifts His hand, we carry that burden as a word or commission from Him. He lays on us a “burden” for a particular situation, and we may carry that impartation for days, weeks, months, or even years.

For example, it might be a burden over the abortion situation in the United States. God’s hand comes upon us and then departs, leaving behind a supernatural enablement of grace, a Holy Spirit endowment to prophesy and intercede in a way we never could before. I have addressed this theme thoroughly in my book Kneeling on the Promises: Birthing God’s Purposes Through Prophetic Intercession.

Another word found in Strong’s Concordance for prophetic impartation is nabiy’, which as we have already seen, is the action of “flowing forth,” or “bubbling forth like a fountain.” This perfectly describes the inspirational gift of prophecy we see so often in meetings, particularly in a setting of a plurality of elders and seasoned, gifted individuals working together as a coordinated team—the “prophetic presbytery” (see 1 Tim. 4:14).

The Seer Realm
Within the overall realm of the prophet lies the particular and distinctive realm of the seer. Remember that I said all true seers are prophets, but not all prophets are seers. The word seer describes a particular type of prophet who receives a particular type of prophetic revelation or impartation.

According to Strong’s Concordance, the Old Testament uses two words primarily to refer to a seer: ra’ah and chozeh. Ra’ah literally means “to see,” particularly in the sense of seeing visions. Other meanings include “to gaze,” “to look upon,” and “to perceive.” Chozeh literally means “a beholder in vision” and can also be translated as “gazer” or “stargazer.”

With these definitions now in place, the distinction between a prophet (nabiy’) and a seer (ra’ah or chozeh) becomes a little clearer. When it comes to prophetic revelation, a prophet is primarily an inspired hearer and then speaker, while a seer is primarily visual. In other words, the prophet is the communicative dimension, and the seer is the receptive dimension. Whereas nabiy’ emphasizes the active work of the prophet in speaking forth a message from God, ra’ah and chozeh focus on the experience or means by which the prophet “sees or perceives” that message. The first places emphasis on a prophet’s relationship with the people; the second places emphasis on a prophet’s revelatory relationship with God.

Apparently, seers were commonly employed in the royal court to offer counsel to the king. Asaph and Gad were both seers in King David’s court:

Moreover, King Hezekiah and the officials ordered the Levites to sing praises to the Lord with the words of David and Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with joy, and bowed down and worshiped (2 Chronicles 29:30).

When David arose in the morning, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying, “Go and speak to David, ‘Thus the Lord says, “I am offering you three things; choose for yourself one of them, which I will do to you” ’ ” (2 Samuel 24:11-12).

In contrast, Nathan also served King David, but the Bible calls him a prophet:

The king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within the tent curtains.” And Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your mind, for the Lord is with you.” But in the same night the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying, “Go and say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the Lord, “Are you the one who should build Me a house to dwell in?”’” (2 Samuel 7:2-5)

Asaph was a seer and Gad was a seer, but Nathan was a prophet. Notice also that Second Samuel 24:11 refers to Gad as both a prophet and a seer. One interesting verse that contains all three Hebrew words is First Chronicles 29:29:

Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the chronicles of Samuel the seer [ra’ah], in the chronicles of Nathan the prophet [nabiy’] and in the chronicles of Gad the seer [chozeh].

Another Scripture clearly reveals the influence of prophets and seers in ancient Israel and their position as spokespeople for God:

He [Hezekiah] then stationed the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals, with harps and with lyres, according to the command of David and of Gad the king’s seer [chozeh], and of Nathan the prophet [nabiy’]; for the command was from the Lord through His prophets (2 Chronicles 29:25).

Nabiy’ prophets and ra’ah and chozeh seers are all legitimate expressions of God’s prophetic stream. As far as prophetic gifting is concerned, prophets and seers are equally valid. First Samuel 9:9 says,

Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he used to say, “Come, and let us go to the seer” [ra’ah]; for he who is called a prophet [nabiy’] now was formerly called a seer [ra’ah].

All true seers are prophets, but not all prophets are seers. A prophet may have the particular grace to hear and proclaim the word of the Lord and yet not necessarily function as profusely in the revelatory visionary capacity as a seer does. The seer, on the other hand, may move quite remarkably in this visionary dream capacity, yet not be as deep in the inspirational audible graces of hearing and speaking. Nevertheless, both move and operate in the prophetic realm, but in different capacities or dimensions.

The seer realm describes a whole other aspect of the way the prophetic operation occurs. Generally speaking, seers are people who see visions in a consistent and regular manner. For the most part, their prophetic anointing is more visionary than auditory. Rather than receiving words that they attempt to repeat or flow with, they often see pictures that they then describe. These pictures may be in the form of waking visions, or as dreams while sleeping.

I know many prophetic nabiy’ people who are not seers at all and who do not move in dream realms, but are nonetheless strong prophetic vessels. At the same time, I know other people who are profoundly gifted in “seeing”—they see angels, demons, lights and colors, dreams and visions—but who do not manifest as much in the inspirational capacity to encourage people spontaneously and verbally.

One of the differences is that, whereas the prophetic word of a nabiy’ is often spontaneous and activated by faith, that of a ra’ah or chozeh seer is more dependent upon the manifested presence of God. Many seers will see something beforehand. For example, before going to a meeting or strategic appointment, a seer may receive a picture of a certain person at that meeting sitting in a certain place dressed in a certain color. The seer may even be given the person’s name. Later, in the meeting, the seer will begin scanning the crowd looking for that particular person. If that person is actually there, this becomes a “green light” for the seer to move forward. For seers, seeing in the natural what they had already seen in the spirit activates their faith and calls forth courage within them.

This kind of prophetic anointing has a lot to do with quietly waiting on God. There are times, as observed from my own experience and that of others, when one waits on God for what seems to be an extended period of time, only to have Him come at the last minute. Quite often, impartation in the seer realm comes only after a time of patient waiting and contemplative meditation upon the Lord. I have often heard it stated: God is slow but He is always on time! But thank the Lord, if we wait, He will come!

Latter-Day Prophetic Streams
In recent years, we have witnessed the re-emergence of two distinct prophetic streams that first appeared over 50 years ago: the seer visionary stream and the nabiy’ verbal stream. As spiritual fathers, Bob Jones perhaps represents the first, while Bishop Bill Hamon exemplifies the second. Founder and director of Christian International Ministries in Florida, Dr. Hamon described the mid-twentieth-century emergence of these two prophetic streams that have reappeared in recent years:

Two streams of restoration came forth in 1947-48. One was the Latter Rain Movement, which restored the practice of…the laying on of hands…as well as extensive congregational prophesying….They emphasized moving into the prophetic realm by faith, grace and gifting. The other restoration stream was what was termed “The Healing and Deliverance Movement.” Their restorational emphasis was laying on of hands for healing, deliverance and world evangelism by preaching with signs and wonders. Both groups were of God and were valid ministries.5

One of the father figures in the Latter Rain Movement was a man named David Shoch, while William Branham was a strongly anointed leader in the Healing and Deliverance Movement. One was a nabiy’ prophet, while the other was a chozeh seer. Each movement had different manifestations and operations.

These parallel streams appeared in the mid-1940s and began to wane in the early 1950s, but both have re-emerged over the past 20 years or so. As a matter of fact, the current expression of the modern prophetic movement in America appeared in the late 1980s, centered in multiple locations: yet was distinctly at that time in Kansas City Fellowship (later Metro Vineyard Fellowship, then Metro Christian Fellowship, and today IHOP-KC) in Kansas City, Missouri. Its then lead pastor was, Mike Bickle, along with prophets such as Bob Jones, John Paul Jackson, Paul Cain, and others. At that time, I also, was recognized as one of the “Kansas City Prophets.”

Central to this new emphasis on prophecy were three core convictions: “that the prophetic gift should be restored in the Church, that prophecy is a natural, biblical means for God to speak to his people, and that…this increased prophetic activity is a sign of the emergence of the last-days victorious Church.”6

Modern-day prophecy in the Church consists of three parts—revelation, interpretation, and application. Great care must always be exercised because of the danger of fallible human instruments misconstruing either the interpretation or the application or both, which happened fairly often in the early days. The movement has grown to encompass multiple streams and locations and has matured greatly since that time, as have its practitioners.

Clearly, the central prophetic figures in the early portion of the Kansas City prophetic movement were Bob Jones and Paul Cain. Both have amazing stories of their own.

Paul was born to a mother who was miraculously healed of terminal tuberculosis, heart disease, and cancer shortly before his birth. He received his first visit from the Lord when he was eight. Even as a teenager, he was on the healing circuit, prophesying to people by telling them their names, their ailments, and that God was healing them. By the 1950s he had a full-time traveling ministry and a television program. Then, like so many revivalists of that period, he seemed to go into an eclipse. He ceased his traveling ministry, gave up his television show, and retreated out of the public eye to rekindle his love for God and devotion to holiness. Paul was released by the Lord in later years with a surge of impact. Since then, he has been to the mountaintop of global ministry, to the pits of failure, and then again in a mode of restoration.

Bob Jones, on the other hand, had an angelic visitation in his youth by an angel of the Lord when residing in rural Arkansas. It was years later, after being in the military, that Bob truly surrendered his heart to Jesus and responded to the calling on his life as a seer prophet. Bob was brought back from a near-death experience to be commissioned by the Lord to anoint leaders who would participate in the end-time harvest of one billion souls coming into the Kingdom.7

In addition to these two streams, I believe there are many other smaller streams of prophetic anointing that are variations of the others. The Christian Church today is experiencing her greatest period of prophetic impartation since the first-century. The river is widening, deepening and growing. Let the river flow!

Two Prophetic Streams: Contrasts and Comparisons
By contrasting and comparing the prophet and seer streams, we can gain a better understanding of how the two work together and complement each other in bringing out the fullest expression of God’s prophetic revelation.

In general, as we saw before, the nabiy’ prophetic anointing tends toward the audible and verbal and is more a communicative dimension. Prophets in this stream often work in a plurality of leadership. Seasoned and gifted individuals, both men and women, minister through the laying on of hands, relating prophecy to individuals or to the corporate Body as it is revealed to them. This ministry often utilizes the spiritual gifts of tongues and the interpretation of tongues, prophecy, and words of knowledge. Nabiy’ prophets “hear” a word in their spirits and begin by releasing this unction. This kind of prophecy tends to be more spontaneous and with a faster flow than “seer” prophecy, with inspiration as the general tone.

Ra’ah or chozeh seers, on the other hand, tend more toward single-person ministry versus the plurality of a team. The seer anointing emphasizes visions and the revelatory gifts mingled with the gift of discerning of spirits rather than the audible, speaking gifts. Within the visionary dimension there are two basic levels of “seeing”: visual and actual.

Visual “seeing” involves insights, revelations, warnings, and prophecies from the Spirit of God that may come in supernatural visual dreams. In such instances, people see God’s revelation while their spirits simply observe and receive the message. Even though asleep, these people may see the heavens opened as Ezekiel did in Ezekiel 1:1 or as John did in Revelation 4:1. The special characteristic of an open-Heaven type of vision is that the higher celestial realms are disclosed, and views, patterns, and heavenly sights of God become seeable.

In contrast, actual “seeing” involves supernatural dreams in which God’s tangible presence is evident or manifested. To see the Lord in a dream is visual, but for Him to manifest Himself to the person dreaming is actual.

Because seers prophesy primarily by sharing what they have seen, they often operate at a slower pace than nabiy’ prophets due to the fact that they are trying to describe supernatural pictures in their own words. Unlike the generally spontaneous nature of nabiy’ prophecy, seers often receive information ahead of time to share at a later date.

Seers often are dependent upon angelic visitations and the manifested presence of God. Consequently, these prophetic vessels may appear to have certain limitations until they sense the anointing. This was supposedly the case with William Branham, one of the leaders of the Healing and Deliverance Movement in the ’40s and ’50s. One day in the late 1940s, he had an angelic encounter that brought with it gifts of healing and a word of knowledge. From that day on, William Branham moved in a very high level of specifics, but with some limitations. Sometimes he would not be able to do anything until his angels showed up. When the angels came, he received release because revelation began to flow.

Prophets and seers represent diversities in the prophetic anointing. As stable and consistent Dr. Bill Hamon said, both are valid ministries, and both are needed in the Church today. God never does anything by accident or without purpose. It is important for all of us to nurture appreciation and respect for all who carry genuine prophetic giftings, no matter how those giftings manifest.

After all, both prophet and seer are servants of the same Lord and have the same goal: to speak that which God has given to them in order to exhort, edify, and comfort the Body of Christ. In a dream I had once, Paul Cain came to me and said, “The seer hears as much as he sees; it’s just a different deep touch from the same dear Jesus.”

Whether nabiy’ or ra’ah, audible or visual, all prophecy comes from the same source: God the Father through Jesus Christ by the present-day ministry of the Holy Spirit. The purpose of both the prophet and the seer is to reveal the glorious wonders of Jesus Christ and God’s purpose in each generation, as well as to bring an awareness of eternity, Heaven and hell, and the Father’s great presence among His people—whether by audible or visual means, and whether by spontaneous inspiration or by reflective contemplation.

Pray for Vision
There are two scriptural prayers that I have prayed regularly, even daily, for over 25 years. I have prayed them over myself, over my family and, through the years, over countless other people. Both prayers have to do with the seer anointing—the capacity to “see” in the spiritual sense.

The first of these is Paul’s great prayer in the first chapter of Ephesians:

[I pray] that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him. I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His might which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come (Ephesians 1:17-21).

Every born-again believer has two sets of eyes. We have our physical eyes, with which we view the physical, created world around us. Paul also talks about a second set of eyes—the eyes of our hearts, or our inner self—which can be enlightened to perceive spiritual truth.

Paul said, “I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened….” I pray the prayer something like this: “Lord, give me that spirit of wisdom; grant me that spirit of revelation so that I will be captured by Jesus Christ.” Then I pray over the eyes of my heart: “Release shafts of revelation light into them, that I might know the hope of Your calling, that I might know the glorious inheritance that lives inside of me, and that I might know the surpassing greatness of Your power that works in me.”

I pray this way and encourage you to do the same because I am convinced that any believer can develop the seer capacity. All prophecy, including the seer dimension, is a sovereign gift of God, but I do not believe it is an exclusive gift. Paul’s prayer makes it clear that if you pray over the eyes of your heart, God will give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him. This means you will come to know the Lord in a way you never could on your own or in your own wisdom.

The other Scripture I have prayed constantly for years is found in Second Kings chapter 6. Here is the situation: The king of Aram wants to capture the prophet Elisha and has sent his army to surround the city of Dothan, where Elisha is living. Elisha’s servant sees the great army and is terrified:

Now when the attendant of the man of God had risen early and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was circling the city. And his servant said to him, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?” So he answered, “Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.” Then Elisha prayed and said, “O Lord, I pray, open his eyes that he may see.” And the Lord opened the servant’s eyes and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha (2 Kings 6:15-17).

This Scripture shows that we can pray for someone else to be enlightened. Elisha was a seer; he saw something his servant could not see, and he prayed, “O Lord…open his eyes that he may see.” It was such a simple prayer, and yet the Lord answered it. He enabled the servant to see into the spiritual realm. Through the prayer of a seer came an impartation to another of the capacity to see.

Nabiy’ and ra’ah, prophet and seer—both carry the prophetic anointing, and both have a significant ministry from the Lord. Much has been written and taught about the nabiy’ prophetic stream, but less has been composed about the ra’ah and chozeh stream of more visionary prophecy. To understand better, we first need to take a closer look at the different varieties of the prophetic anointing. So come on the journey with me, and let’s learn to bless and receive from both streams of the prophetic movement in our day that together comprise one great river of God.
