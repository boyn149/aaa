# THE DIVERSITY OF VISIONARY STATES 

There is only one Holy Spirit, but He works in a multiplicity of ways. There are many spiritual gifts, but only one gift-giver: the Holy Spirit of God. The prophetic anointing manifests itself in many diverse ways, but they all derive from the same Spirit. As Paul wrote to the Corinthians:

Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord. There are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all persons. But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues. But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills (1 Corinthians 12:4-11).

This same diversity by the one Spirit applies also to visionary states and experiences. In fact, the New Testament uses a variety of Greek words to express different visionary states. None of these states are “higher” or “better” than any of the others. They are simply different, and the Holy Spirit uses them with different people for different purposes.

Let’s take a closer look at some of these visionary states. Examining each one in turn will give us a better understanding of, and appreciation for, the wide diversity of this form of the prophetic seer anointing. Let’s investigate eight different words that will unfold eight complementary expressions.

1. Onar
According to Vine’s Expository Dictionary, onar in Greek is the common word for “dream.” It refers simply to the kind of dreaming we all do when we sleep. Everyday dreams are themselves visionary in nature, because our minds generate images that we “see” while we are asleep. As the Bible makes clear, God can and does use these common dreams to communicate with ordinary people. Let’s look at three examples.

According to Matthew, God spoke to Joseph, the earthly father of Jesus, through a dream—not once, but three times:

But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream,[onar] saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.”…And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took Mary as his wife, but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son; and he called His name Jesus (Matthew 1:20, 24-25).

Now when they had gone, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream [onar] and said, “Get up! Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search for the Child to destroy Him.” So Joseph got up and took the Child and His mother while it was still night, and left for Egypt (Matthew 2:13-14).

But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream [onar] to Joseph in Egypt, and said, “Get up, take the Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel; for those who sought the Child’s life are dead.” So Joseph got up, took the Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel (Matthew 2:19-21).

Notice on these occasions that even though Joseph experienced dreams during normal sleep, he recognized that the dreams were from the Lord, and was quick to obey their messages.

After finding and worshiping the infant Jesus in Bethlehem, the wise men also received a word from the Lord through a common dream:

And having been warned by God in a dream [onar] not to return to Herod, the magi left for their own country by another way (Matthew 2:12).

In this case, a common dream was involved, but the uncommon element was that apparently all of the magi had the same dream! Let us pray for that to occur today!

On occasion, God even speaks to unbelievers through an onar dream:

While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous Man; for last night I suffered greatly in a dream [onar] because of Him” (Matthew 27:19).

Pontius Pilate was sitting in judgment over Jesus when his own wife warned him of the dream about Jesus that had troubled her the night before. Here is biblical proof of God passing along “secret information” in the form of a warning dream to an unbeliever, a woman who was not even part of the covenant people of God. The Lord is absolutely sovereign, and He can speak to anyone He wishes, any way He wishes, any time He wishes. Many times He does so through a common dream, an onar.

2. Enupnion
Like onar, Vine’s Expository Dictionary relates the word enupnion to a vision or dream received while asleep. The difference with enupnion is that it stresses a surprise quality that is contained in that dream. One example of the word is found in the Book of Jude:

Yet in the same way these men, also by dreaming [enupnion], defile the flesh, and reject authority, and revile angelic majesties. But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, “The Lord rebuke you!” (Jude 8-9)

The phrase “these men” refers to certain “ungodly persons” who have “crept in unnoticed” (Jude 4) seeking to corrupt the Church and deny Christ. In context, Jude likens them to the angels who rebelled against God and to the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, who were destroyed because of their great sinfulness and immorality. In the same way, “these men” in Jude 8 have given themselves over to sensuous dreamings that defile the flesh and, just like Sodom and Gomorrah, are setting themselves up for a sudden and shocking surprise when God’s judgment falls on them.

Another instance of the word enupnion is found in the second chapter of Acts:

“And it shall be in the last days,” God says, “that I will pour forth of My Spirit on all mankind; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams [enupnion]” (Acts 2:17).

Literally, the phrase “shall dream dreams” means “shall be given up to dream by dreams.” This is the kind of dream that really sticks with you after you wake up. Something about it startled you and made your senses alert, perhaps some kind of shocking quality to the dream that caused you to remember it vividly.

I have had several of this type of encounter. Once, when I was ministering in Argentina, I dreamed that an angel was in my room. In the middle of the night, I awoke suddenly to find my room permeated with an atmosphere of awe, surprise, and amazement. Before I knew what was happening, I was catapulted into an open vision of this very same angel manifesting itself at the end of my bed and declaring to me, “Seize the moment!” Immediately I found myself supernaturally filled with the energy of God and the power for my appointment. Yes, sometimes a “surprise element” is released through these seer encounters. Watch out: ready or not, here He comes!

3. Horama
According to Vine’s Expository Dictionary, horama is another general term for vision, meaning “that which is seen.” It carries the particular sense of a “spectacle, sight, or appearance.” New Testament examples commonly associate this word with waking visions.

Matthew uses horama to describe the vision Peter, James, and John saw at the Transfiguration of Jesus:

As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, “Tell the vision [horama] to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead” (Matthew 17:9).

In the Book of Acts, Ananias received his instructions to go to Saul through a horama. The Lord used the same means to let Saul know that Ananias was coming:

Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision [horama], “Ananias.” And he said, “Here I am, Lord.” And the Lord said to him, “Get up and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying, and he has seen in a vision [horama] a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him, so that he might regain his sight” (Acts 9:10-12).

The tenth chapter of Acts tells the story of Cornelius, the Roman centurion, and Simon Peter, and how the Lord used visions to bring the two men together. Cornelius, a God-fearing man, was praying one day when an angel appeared to him:

About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw in a vision [horama] an angel of God who had just come in and said to him, “Cornelius!” And fixing his gaze on him and being much alarmed, he said, “What is it, Lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and alms have ascended as a memorial before God” (Acts 10:3-4).

Following the angel’s instructions, Cornelius sent for Simon Peter, who was in Joppa. The next day, while Peter was on the roof of the house where he was staying, he had a vision (see Acts 10:9-16). In these verses, the Greek word used to describe Peter’s vision is ekstasis, which means “trance” (see below). Afterward, when Peter was trying to understand what he had seen, the word horama is used. As Peter pondered the meaning of his vision, the men sent by Cornelius arrived.

While Peter was reflecting on the vision [horama], the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are looking for you. But get up, go downstairs and accompany them without misgivings, for I have sent them Myself” (Acts 10:19-20).

The apostle Paul also was no stranger to visions. There were times when Paul received direction for his ministry while in a visionary state. One such instance led to the Gospel entering eastern Europe for the very first time:

A vision [horama] appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing and appealing to him, and saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.” When he had seen the vision [horama], immediately we sought to go into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them (Acts 16:9-10).

On another occasion, God used a vision to encourage Paul and to instruct him to settle and preach in the city of Corinth for a while:

And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision [horama], “Do not be afraid any longer, but go on speaking and do not be silent; for I am with you, and no man will attack you in order to harm you, for I have many people in this city.” And he settled there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them (Acts 18:9-11).

You can be a candidate for horama visions as well. Just tell the Lord of your desire to be a person who receives the spirit of revelation and sees visions. It is in His Word. It is for today. It is there for the asking!

4. Horasis
As Vine’s Expository Dictionary shows, this word horasis, which occurs only twice in the Greek New Testament, refers to sight or vision in either an external or internal sense. The Greek language makes no distinction between the perception of the physical eye and the non-physical eye; both external and internal “seeing” are regarded as genuine perception.

We all have two sets of eyes: our physical or natural eyes and the “eyes” of our heart, with which we “see” into the spiritual realm. It was this second set of eyes that the apostle Paul was referring to in Ephesians 1:18 when he said, “I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened…” Those are the “eyes” through which we see and understand spiritual truth. The Bible says that our bodies are temples for the Holy Spirit. Every temple has windows and doors. When the Lord comes to dwell in our “temples,” He likes to be able to look out His “windows.” Our eyes—physical and spiritual—are the windows to our soul.

The first occurrence of horasis in the New Testament is found in Acts 2:17 in the phrase, “your young men shall see visions…. Revelation 4:3 contains the only other instance of this Greek word:

And He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance [horasis]; and there was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance [horasis].

In this case, the word is used in its external sense of the aspect of one’s appearance.

Stated simply, a vision—a horasis—occurs when the Spirit who lives within us looks out through the “windows” of our eyes and allows us to see what He sees. Are we seeing in the natural or in the spiritual realm? Sometimes it is hard to tell, and sometimes it is both. When our spiritual eyes are open, sometimes our natural eyes can see into the spiritual realm. We may see dual images as visionary spiritual pictures are superimposed over the images we are seeing with our physical eyes.

Some years ago when we lived in another home, I was standing on the deck in our backyard watching our children play on the swing set. At one end of the swing set was a small slide. As I stood watching my children, my spiritual eyes opened up for just a few moments. Although I continued to see the natural image of the swing set, my children, and the slide, with my spiritual vision, I now saw also a small, round swimming pool at the bottom of the slide. While I watched, a full-grown adult man slid down the slide headfirst on his back into the pool.

My first reaction was to ask, “What is that?” To my wonderful amazement, a response came immediately. I heard a voice speak in my spirit, “I will restore the backslidden man into the pool of My purpose.” I knew then that the Holy Spirit had given me the interpretation of the vision. It was very encouraging to me. In the years since, I have used that phrase many times in intercession, calling for the backslidden man to be restored into the pool of God’s purpose. That revelation came to me through a horasis vision in which I saw with both my natural eyes and my spiritual eyes simultaneously.

5. Optasia
Another visionary state found in the New Testament is denoted by the word optasia—which, according to Vine’s Expository Dictionary, literally means “visuality,” or in concrete form, “apparition.” Optasia has the very specific connotation of self-disclosure or of letting oneself be seen. The word occurs three times in the New Testament, always in the context of someone seeing a divine or spiritual personage.

For example, in the first chapter of Luke, Zechariah the priest sees a vision of the archangel Gabriel while performing his duties in the temple. Gabriel informs Zechariah that he and his wife, Elizabeth, will have a son, whom they are to name John. Their son would grow up to become John the Baptist. Because Zechariah has trouble believing Gabriel’s word, the angel tells him that he will be unable to speak until everything comes to pass. Undoubtedly, Zechariah was profoundly moved by his vision:

But when he came out, he was unable to speak to them; and they realized that he had seen a vision [optasia] in the temple; and he kept making signs to them, and remained mute (Luke 1:22).

The second instance of the use of optasia is in connection with Luke’s account of the Resurrection of Jesus. Two of Jesus’ disciples are on the road to Emmaus, conversing with the risen Jesus, although they do not recognize Him. One of them says to Jesus:

But also some women among us amazed us. When they were at the tomb early in the morning, and did not find His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision [optasia] of angels who said that He was alive (Luke 24:22-23).

Paul also used optasia in the twelfth chapter of Second Corinthians to describe in the third person a visionary experience of his own:

Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I will go on to visions [optasia] and revelations of the Lord. I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven. And I know how such a man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows—was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which a man is not permitted to speak (2 Corinthians 12:1-4).

Paul’s description reveals another dimension of optasia: not only does the vision involve seeing a divine or angelic personage, but the person experiencing the vision may see himself or herself participating in it as if from a third-person perspective. This is the self-disclosure aspect of an optasia-type vision.

After my father, Wayne Goll, had passed away to be with the Lord, I was ministering in Atlanta, Georgia, at a prophetic conference. I had spoken that night on “Gate Keepers of His Presence.” At the close of the service, I fell on my knees on the platform and was overwhelmed with the beauty of the Lord. Several people were prostrate on the floor seeking the Lord’s face.

All of a sudden, as I wept openly, I saw an external picture of my father’s face looking right at me. I was stunned by the vision that I saw. I continued to weep, and the Holy Spirit spoke to me, “I have a word to give to you from your father.” Again, my father’s face appeared right before me. He had passed away from a sickness that had left him as a shell of the strong man he had been. In this open-eyed vision, he appeared healed, strong, and vibrant. I then heard words spoken straight into my heart a second time, “I have a word to give to you from your father.” Simple, clear words proceeded as I looked at the vision of my father’s face smiling right at me: “I understand you now!” Healing flowed into my being. What an experience! What a blessing! It touched my heart deeply in a way that only God could do. What a personal God!

6. Ekstasis
Next we come to the word ekstasis, from which our English word ecstasy is derived. Ekstasis occurs seven times in the New Testament according to Vine’s Expository Dictionary, and, depending on how it is used, means amazement, astonishment, or a trance. Literally, ekstasis means “a displacement of the mind,” or “bewilderment.” When translated as “trance,” ekstasis refers to one being caught up in the Spirit so as to receive those revelations that God intends. This is very likely the state that John was referring to in Revelation 1:10 when he wrote, “I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet.”

A good example of the first meaning of ekstasis is found in Luke 5:26: “They were all struck with astonishment [ekstasis] and began glorifying God; and they were filled with fear, saying, ‘We have seen remarkable things today.’” This verse describes the response of the crowd who witnessed Jesus’ healing of a paralyzed man whose friends had lowered him through the roof in order to get him to Jesus.

The third chapter of Acts records a similar situation where Peter heals a beggar who was born lame:

And all the people saw him walking and praising God; and they were taking note of him as being the one who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple to beg alms, and they were filled with wonder and amazement [ekstasis] at what had happened to him (Acts 3:9-10).

In both of these cases, the people who witnessed these miracles were so astonished that they were caught up in some form of an ecstatic experience.

On the morning of Jesus’ Resurrection, three of the women who had followed Him came to His tomb to anoint His body. Instead, they found the tomb empty and saw an angel of God, who told them that He had risen from the dead and would meet with them again in Galilee. How did they respond to this angelic visitation? “They went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment [ekstasis] had gripped them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid” (Mark 16:8).

Ekstasis also means “trance,” as in Acts 10:10 when Peter has his vision on the rooftop in Joppa before his visit to Cornelius: “But he became hungry and was desiring to eat; but while they were making preparations, he fell into a trance [ekstasis].” A similar thing happened to Paul one day when he was praying at the temple in Jerusalem:

It happened when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I fell into a trance [ekstasis], and I saw Him saying to me, “Make haste, and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me” (Acts 22:17-18).

A trance is a form of ecstatic experience. In our day and age, trances have gotten a bad name because of their association with the New Age movement and the occult. The experiences of Peter and Paul reveal that a trance, although perhaps not as common as some other types of visions, is nonetheless a legitimate and biblical form of a visionary state that God may choose to use in imparting revelation to His people. I will deal more with trances in Chapter Nine.

7. Apokalupsis
With apokalupsis, we come to the most frequently used word in the New Testament to describe a visionary state. The word occurs 18 times—once in Luke, once in Revelation, three times in First Peter, and the rest in six of Paul’s letters. Usually translated “revelation,” apokalupsis, according to Vine’s Expository Dictionary, literally means “disclosure,” an “appearing,” “coming,” or a “manifestation.” It carries specifically the sense of something hidden that has now been uncovered or revealed.

This sense of the word is clear in the sixteenth chapter of Romans, where Paul writes:

Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation [apokalupsis] of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past, but now is manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, leading to obedience of faith; to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be the glory forever. Amen (Romans 16:25-27).

Paul uses the same word in Ephesians 1:17 when he prays “that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation [apokalupsis] in the knowledge of Him.”

In several instances, apokalupsis appears in connection with the “revelation” or “appearing” of Christ at His return. Peter especially uses the word in this context:

In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation [apokalupsis] of Jesus Christ;…Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation [apokalupsis] of Jesus Christ (1 Peter 1:6-7,13).

Have you ever had an experience where you suddenly felt like a little light went on inside? You may not necessarily have had an actual vision, but just a sense that something that you did not understand, something that was hidden from you, was now revealed. That is an apokalupsis-type experience.

Of course, the most familiar use of the word apokalupsis is Revelation 1:1:

The Revelation [apokalupsis] of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His bond-servants, the things which must soon take place; and He sent and communicated it by His angel to His bond-servant John.

This is where our English word apocalypse comes from.

Because of its association with the Book of Revelation, with all of its graphic depictions of disaster and symbolic imagery, apocalypse has come to mean for many people the idea of catastrophic events, particularly related to the end of the world. For many people, the Book of Revelation is full of cryptic puzzles and tantalizing mysteries that are hard to grasp. It is important, therefore, to remember that apocalypse or apokalupsis does not mean “hidden,” but “revelation,” or an “unveiling.” Expect the Holy Spirit to reveal mysteries to you from the Word of God and through supernatural encounters of a heavenly kind!

8. Egenomehn ehn pneumati
Finally, I want to examine one Greek phrase that has significance to the whole scope of the prophetic visionary state. I mentioned earlier that John, the writer of Revelation, may have been in a trance state—ekstasis—during the time he received his revelation from the Lord. Although John himself does not use that word to describe his state, he does use the phrase egenomehn ehn pneumati, which means “I was in the Spirit”:

I, John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance which are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. I was in the Spirit [egenomehn ehn pneumati] on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet… (Revelation 1:9-10).

The phrase egenomehn ehn pneumati literally means “to become in the Spirit,” a state in which one could see visions and be informed or spoken directly to by the Spirit of God. Therein lies the secret to how we get revelation. How do we receive insight? How do we see visions? We do it by first getting in the Spirit. The more we are filled with the Spirit and walk in the Spirit, the more we become one with the Spirit, and the more our eyes will be opened to see in the Spirit. He will give us the perception to look into the spiritual realm.

Luke uses a similar phrase when he writes:

Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit [plere pneumato hagiou], returned from the Jordan and was led around by the Spirit in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And He ate nothing during those days, and when they had ended, He became hungry (Luke 4:1-2).

Notice that the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where He was tempted by the devil. That fact opens up a whole new dimension for us. The Spirit can bring us into the realm of the Spirit for the purpose not only of seeing into the heavenly realms or discerning the intentions and motives that lie in the hearts of people, but also of seeing into the demonic realm in preparation for doing battle with the kingdom of darkness.

This leads to a principle that is important for all of us, whether or not we are moving under a particular seer or visionary anointing at any given time: we should always engage the devil on God’s terms, not ours, and never interact with the devil on his terms. As always, Jesus is our example. In the wilderness, Jesus was full of the Spirit and led by the Spirit, and from that place He had victory over the devil. The only way we can ever hope to engage satan and come out victorious is to be filled with and led by the Holy Spirit. This means that we should not seek out encounters with the enemy. We are to seek God. If we are faithfully seeking to live for Christ, those encounters will come to us because the devil will seek us out. We are a threat to the kingdom of darkness. We can enter the fray in the fullness and power of the Spirit, and then together we overcome the enemy. Remember that victory is “‘not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,’ says the Lord of hosts” (Zech. 4:6b).

Filled and led by the Spirit, we have the power, as Jesus did, to encounter and defeat the enemy. It is only under the Lord’s umbrella of protection that we are safe. Realize that each one of us has a distinct gift and calling in God. We are all called to the battle, but some are called as warriors with a gift of faith or other gift mix that enables them in their assignment.

Cindy Jacobs, co-founder of Generals of Intercession and a prophetess of the Lord, walks in the keen gift of discerning of spirits. This enables her to distinguish evil spirits that hinder God’s purposes and also to sense, see, or perceive the angelic presence assigned by the Lord over a given region. I have seen her get in the Spirit (egenomehn ehn pneumati) and then be used by the Lord in this wonderful dimension. Demonic forces are pushed back as this temporary present darkness is pierced through by God’s light.

There is much to learn in all of these facets and spheres of the revelatory anointings. We need the wisdom, enlightenment, and knowledge of the Holy Spirit in order to wisely judge the revelation we receive. But He promises He will give it. He will not give us experiences or gifts without teaching us how to properly use them!
