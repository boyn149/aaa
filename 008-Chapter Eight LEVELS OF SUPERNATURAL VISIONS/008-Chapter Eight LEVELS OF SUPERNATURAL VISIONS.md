# LEVELS OF SUPERNATURAL VISIONS 

How do visions “happen”?

For me, they began as what I would call mental pictures. After I was filled with the Holy Spirit in 1972, I began receiving “flashes” of light—mental images or pictures that lasted a second or less. At the time I did not know that they were legitimate “visions.” I did not know what to call them. In those days, there were no seminars or conferences and very little writing or teaching on the subject of visions, let alone The Seer! Through a slow process of growth, I gradually learned that these mental “snapshots” were visual insights from the Holy Spirit. The more I grew and matured in the visionary arena, the more sustained the images became.

A mental “snapshot” is a good way to describe how visions can happen. Think of how an instant camera works. The shutter opens, allowing light to enter through the lens, imprinting on the film the image that is in front of the lens. The film develops “instantly” so the image can be viewed and analyzed. In a vision, “light” from the Lord enters the “lens” of our spiritual eyes and imprints an image on the “film” of our hearts and our minds. As the image “develops,” we gain a better understanding of what it means. Most visions are internal in nature. An image is ingrained in our memory, and we can take it out, look at it, and study it any time we need to.

Another way to explain in simple language how visions happen is to think of each believer in Christ as a house or temple. First Corinthians 6:19 says that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit. As Christians, we have Jesus in the power of the Holy Spirit living in us; He dwells inside our “houses.” Houses generally have windows that let in light. Our eyes are the windows of our soul. Sometimes Jesus, who lives in our houses, likes to look out of His windows and share with us what He sees. That is when a vision occurs—we see what Jesus sees when He looks out the windows of His house.

Whether we see it internally or externally, as if on a large projection screen, is not of primary importance. Our first priority is to be sensitive to the Spirit’s desire to let us see what He sees. Just look through the eyes of Jesus—He wants to share with you what He is seeing!

Supernatural visions are recorded throughout the Bible. Within the pages of the Scriptures we can identify at least 12 different types or levels of visionary supernatural experience. Let us examine each one briefly, moving progressively from the simplest to the most profound.

Spiritual Perception
I speak the things which I have seen with My Father (John 8:38a).

As the lowest level of supernatural vision, spiritual perception may or may not involve a literal “seeing.” Perception is not limited to the visual. Spiritual perception is the realm of knowing, of impression. In this type of vision, people may “see” something in their spirits, but their minds see no image. The Holy Spirit often reveals things to us by an unction or, to use a more familiar word, an anointing. Yet we may not be able to describe those things pictorially. Often, a hunch, a prompting, or a “gut feeling” we have is due to a perception in our inner self receiving nudges from the Holy Spirit.

Jesus walked by faith and always pleased His Father (see John 8:29). He discerned (saw) His Father’s acts and acted accordingly: “I speak the things which I have seen with My Father” (John 8:38a). He also knew (perceived the innermost heart of) all people:

But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to them, for He knew all men, and because He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man (John 2:24-25.)

It seems that in the life of Jesus, His spiritual eyes perceived things that His mind did not always visualize. Such spiritual perceptions could be the operation of the gift of a word of wisdom, word of knowledge, discerning of spirits, the gift of faith or even the gift of prophecy. Often, the higher the level of spiritual vision, the higher the dimension of spiritual sight that occurs. I, like you, want to follow Jesus’ example and “do what we see the Father doing.”

Pictorial Vision
If there is a prophet among you, I, the Lord, shall make Myself known to him in a vision. I shall speak with him in a dream (Numbers 12:6b).

In a pictorial vision, an image is revealed and can be identified and described in terms of pictures. They are Holy Spirit visual aids! Symbols may or may not be involved. Often, the revelatory gifts come to us in the form of a pictorial vision that we see with our inner sight. However, a pictorial vision also may come in a picture superimposed over the subject. In other words, we might see two things at once: the main scene in the natural, with the object of the pictorial vision placed over or around it. I often see Scriptures written on people’s foreheads. This is a useful tool, as it depicts something they are deeply pondering, or serves as medicine from the Lord to help them in their current or future situation. I often have to look up the verse and read it to them. This level of vision begins to enter both the internal and external arenas.

For another example, when praying for the sick, one may “see” an image of a bodily organ, a bone, or another body part flash in his or her mind. This indicates what to pray for or leads to dialogue with the person being ministered to. A pictorial vision is the type that is manifested when a Christian is praying for an individual, and the Holy Spirit starts showing things in “snapshots.” This person may say, “The Lord is showing me…” or “I am seeing…” or “Does this picture mean anything to you?” This is because pictorial visions are presenting distinct pictures in his or her mind, and not only in the spirit, as is the case with spiritual perception.

Years ago, when I was pastoring a church in the Midwest, I “saw” an image of an inflamed stomach. I mentioned it from the platform, but no one came forth with that particular ailment. But I could not get away from the vision. After a little while, one woman in the group went downstairs to the nursery in the basement to relieve her daughter, who was tending the children’s nursery. When the young lady came up the stairs and through the back door of the sanctuary into the main meeting, a “knowing” went off on the inside of me. I knew she was the one. As it turned out, the daughter had an inflamed stomach, a pre-ulcerous condition. She came forward, and the power of the Holy Spirit came upon her, and the Lord healed her completely that night!

It all began while in worship with a momentary pictorial vision in my mind of the affected organ. That is very often how these visions work.

Panoramic Vision
I have also spoken to the prophets, and I gave numerous visions, and through the prophets I gave parables (Hosea 12:10).

A panoramic vision is one in which a person sees a pictorial vision, not in snapshot form, but in motion in his or her mind. This “motion picture” may last several seconds and may include words heard in the realm of the spirit.

A panorama is a picture that unfolds before the spectators in such a way as to give the impression of a continuous view. Acts 9:10-16 records two panoramic visions. First, Ananias receives a vision that he is to go and lay his hands on Saul (later to be called Paul) so that he may receive his sight back. The second vision is that which Saul himself, although blind, had “seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him, so that he might regain his sight” (Acts 9:12). In both cases, the Greek word for “vision” is horama, one of the roots for our English word panorama. It is interesting that this is the term used often for cinema—it is panoramic. Both Ananias and Saul saw a “motion picture” vision of what was going to come about.

I remember when I received my call to the nations after receiving prayer from the healing evangelist Mahesh Chavda. As I was resting on the floor, I could see a list of nations in typed print roll before my eyes. It happened three times (I guess I needed to get the picture!). Over a period of years, I have ministered in all the nations that “panned” before my eyes. It took 20 years, but God has been faithful to fulfill the vision He gave to me that glorious morning.

Dream (Sleeping Vision)
In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel saw a dream and visions in his mind as he lay on his bed; then he wrote the dream down and related the following summary of it (Daniel 7:1).

We looked at dreams and dream language earlier, but let’s review them briefly for comparison. A dream is a visionary revelation from the Holy Spirit that one receives while asleep. Supernatural dreams can occur in any level of sleep: light rest, regular sleep, deep sleep, or even in a trance state. Any one of the revelation gifts, or any combination of them, may manifest in a dream. Symbols may or may not be present. In any given situation, an entire scenario may be revealed in the dream.

It says in the Book of Job:

Indeed God speaks once, or twice, yet no one notices it. In a dream, a vision of the night, when sound sleep falls on men, while they slumber in their beds, then He opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction (Job 33:14-16).

God wants to speak to us, but often during the day He can hardly get a word in edgewise. When we are asleep, however, our souls become more rested and more inclined to receive from Him. Then He can open our ears and give us instruction on various levels.

We need to be thankful to God for His persistence! After all, He often tries talking to us during the daytime, but we do not listen. Rather than giving up, God waits until we are asleep, then releases His secret service agents—His gifts of revelation—to come upon us in our sleep. God comes in quietly at night and says, “I want to talk to you.” That is how supernatural dreams come about.

Dreams do not happen because of the pizza or pickles or anything else we eat. They happen because of God’s love. God wants us to watch with Him. He wants us to see and hear more than we want to see and hear. If He has trouble getting in through the front door, He will come in through the rear—through dreams.

Audible Messages
And behold, a voice out of the heavens said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased” (Matthew 3:17).

Often, visions include a voice speaking a message along with a visual image. Sometimes a message is declared apart from any visual pictures. Audible messages in the spiritual realm can involve people speaking words or objects making sounds. We can perceive such messages inside of us by our inner ears or outside of us by our physical ears.

Voices or sounds we hear internally can indeed be messages from the Lord. That which we hear outside of us—a message from above and beyond the natural mind and ears—is called a supernatural audible message. Audible messages from the Lord come in many ways: the Holy Spirit, Jesus, the Father, angels of the Lord of various realms, and numerous other sounds He uses.

Audible voices that are unfamiliar to us may bring doubt and confusion or even fear. Deceiving or seducing spirits are usually the ones who behave mysteriously, as though they have something to hide. The word occult means “hidden.” The enemy tries to hide, but we can flush satan and his cohorts out through the blood of Jesus. Just test the spirits to determine if they are from God.

God is not the author of doubt, confusion, or fear. When God releases His message to us, even through one of His angels, we should sense purity and holiness, a reverence to the Lord, and openness, because they have nothing to hide. The Spirit of God is not afraid to be tested. We should never fear offending God by testing the spirits. On the contrary, God is honored when we do because He told us in His Word to do so (see 1 John 4:1-3).

The infamous morning of 9/11/01, the voice of the Holy Spirit came to me in an external audible manner. He said, “The hunters have just been released!” I was familiar with this term from my history in prayer and carrying God’s heart for the Jewish people. I then sensed an urgency to turn on the television. Sure enough—like millions of others—I saw the footage of the World Trade Towers being destroyed by terrorists. The Holy Spirit was giving a portion of God’s interpretation to the events of our time by warning me, “The hunters have just been released.” Indeed, we are living in days when the spirits of terror, antichrist, and anti-Semitism are increasing.

The Bible is full of examples where individuals heard God or an angel speak in an audible voice:

God speaks from Heaven when Jesus is baptized (see Matt. 3:17).
God speaks to Peter, James, and John on the Mount of Transfiguration (see Luke 9:28-36).
An angel speaks to Philip (see Acts 8:26).
The Lord Jesus speaks to Saul on the road to Damascus (see Acts 9:3-7).
The Holy Spirit speaks to the prophets, teachers, and other believers at Antioch (see Acts 13:1-3).
We should not be afraid of the possibility of hearing an audible voice from the Lord. Rest assured! Jesus said that His sheep know His voice (see John 10:27). He is a great teacher—the greatest teacher in all of history. He is the Teacher, and He wants us to hear His voice even more than we want to hear it!

An Appearance (Apparition)
And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the altar of incense (Luke 1:11).

At this level of supernatural vision, people see beings that literally appear to them seemingly “out of thin air.” This appearance may be observed with the natural eyes, either open or closed, and may even be a tangible experience. In some cases, it may be perceived physically—the being’s presence may be felt—without being obviously seen. It is an appearing, a visiting, but not necessarily a sighting.

An appearance or apparition is different from a pictorial vision in that it is an actual—perhaps tangible and audible—visitation occurring outside of the person. Pictorial visions, by themselves, are basically symbolic revelations with images shown to the mind by the Holy Spirit. These images may be of a person, a place, a thing, or any combination of these. In an apparition, an object, a place, a person, an angel, or Jesus Himself might actually appear. These appearances can be “interactive” as well.

As with the audible voice, the Bible contains many examples of people seeing apparitions. Here are just a few:

Jacob physically wrestled with an angel (see Gen. 32:24-31).
Joshua saw Jesus (in His pre incarnate form), the captain of the Lord’s army (see Josh. 5:13-15).
Zacharias saw the archangel Gabriel (see Luke 1:11).
Mary also saw the archangel Gabriel (see Luke 1:26-38).
The risen Christ appeared to His followers on numerous occasions for 40 days after His Resurrection (see Acts 1:3).
The disciples saw the Holy Spirit appear on the Day of Pentecost as “tongues of fire” (see Acts 2:3).
An angel appeared to Cornelius with a message from God (see Acts 10:1-6).
I will never forget the fall of 1993 when God’s angels came and invaded our home with the presence of God. It started with a lightning bolt crash in our backyard as electric white light pierced through our bedroom window at 11:59 at night. As I was suddenly awakened, I saw a man standing in our room addressing me, “Watch your wife. I am about to speak to her!” This began a nine-week period of visitations of fire, the angels of Heaven, and the glorious intrusion of His presence that consumed my wife. Heaven invaded our home and my wife was “changed and rearranged” by the power and presence of God. This arena is real—as my wife, Michal Ann, testified often during her lifetime!

Divine Sight
So Moses said, “I must turn aside now and see this marvelous sight, why the bush is not burned up” (Exodus 3:3).

More than just a spiritual vision, a divine sight is an actual disclosing of a supernatural event. It is like an appearance or apparition, in that it is an actual occurrence outside of the person or persons experiencing it. With divine sight, however, the vision is not of a being, but of an object or activity in the spiritual realm being disclosed to the natural realm.

When Moses was near Mount Sinai, he actually saw a bush burning without it being consumed. This great sight and the penetrating voice he heard from within it were divine manifestations of God. On that holy ground, the Lord conversed with Moses and commissioned and anointed him to deliver His people, Israel, from Egyptian bondage.

Other biblical accounts of divine sight include:

At the time God gave the law to Moses on Mount Sinai, He descended upon the mountain in the form of thunder, lightning, fire, and smoke (see Exod. 19:16-18).
Moses and the elders saw the Lord with a sapphire pavement under His feet (see Exod. 24:9-10).
When the temple that Solomon built was dedicated in Jerusalem, the glory cloud of the Lord descended and filled the temple (see 2 Chron. 5:13-14).
While Saul was on the road to Damascus, a light from the sky, which was disclosed in the first heaven, shone around him, and he saw Jesus (see Acts 26:13-19).
Open Heaven
Now it came about in the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was by the river Chebar among the exiles, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God (Ezekiel 1:1).

An open Heaven is a vision where a hole seems to appear in the immediate sky, the celestial realm is disclosed, and heavenly sights of God become seeable. The term open Heaven originated in historic revivals to describe those times when the manifested presence of God seems to come down in a tangible manner as conviction of sin, conversions, and healings take place. We are now moving from an era of prophetic renewal into a new epoch of the Holy Spirit. We are crossing a threshold into a period of apostolic open Heavens for whole cities and regions to be visited by the presence of the Almighty.

Examples of an open Heaven are found throughout the Scriptures. Here are four instances:

Ezekiel states that “the heavens were opened.” He then describes a great cloud sent by God to protect Ezekiel from His brightness. Then he sees flashing lightning, brilliant light, angels, and other details (see Ezek. 1:1-4).
At Jesus’ baptism, the “heavens were opened” and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in the form of a dove. Then the Father spoke audibly, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased” (see Matt. 3:16-17).
As Stephen was being stoned for preaching the Gospel, he looked up into Heaven and saw “the sky loosened and the clouds rolled back” and Jesus standing to receive him (see Acts 7:55-56).
The apostle John was about 80 years old and in exile on the island of Patmos when, while meditating on the Lord’s day, he heard a voice and saw “a door opened in heaven.” He is then shown the One who walks among the lampstands and receives many detailed messages from the Lord (see Rev. 1).
The book The Heavens Opened by Anna Rountree vividly describes a modern-day account of open Heavens. In a similar manner to that of John the Beloved, on the eve of Hanukkah, 1994, in a cabin on a lake in Texas, the Heavens opened. Anna was caught up in a tremendous vision of satan’s brutal attack on the Church. Suddenly, the revelation led her to a stairway into the actual realm of Heaven, by which she escaped the terrible attack. There Anna was met and taught by the angels and by the Lord Jesus Himself. At the end of the encounter, she stood trembling before God the Father as He ordered her to release what she had seen and heard. He commissioned her to compose “letters from home to the homesick” and to share His heart of unbounded love for His children and for the lost.1

This is but one example of humble authentic vessels in our day who are receiving open Heavens and other levels of revelatory activity in their lives. These experiences are on the increase. As the last days unfold, such encounters will only multiply!

Trance
It happened when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I fell into a trance (Acts 22:17).

Because it is so easily misunderstood today and is linked in so many people’s minds with New Age and the occult, we must be very careful in dealing with the subject of trances. For this reason, the next chapter is devoted to an in-depth look at this type of vision. For now, here is a brief overview.

A trance is more or less a stunned state wherein a person’s body is overwhelmed by the Spirit of God, and that person’s mind can be arrested and subjected to visions or revelations that God desires to impart. The New Testament Greek word for trance is ekstasis, from which our English word ecstasy is derived. Basically, a trance is a supernaturally incited excitement of the physical body. Often, a person in a trance is stupefied—held, arrested, and placed in a supernormal (above normal or other-than-normal) state of mind. Vine’s Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words defines trance as “a condition in which ordinary consciousness and the perception of natural circumstances were withheld, and the soul was susceptible only to the vision imparted by God.”2 Another definition of trance is a rapturous state whereby one is caught up into the spiritual realm so as to only receive those things that the Holy Spirit speaks.

Below are eight biblical examples that could be said to describe various forms of a trance-like state:

Amazement (see Mark 16:8).
Astonishment (see Mark 5:42).
Falling as if dead (see Rev. 1:17). The word ekstasis is not used here, but the condition of falling as if dead aptly describes a trance-like state.
A great quaking (see Dan. 10:7).
A trembling or a shaking (see Job 4:14).
A sudden power (see Ezek. 8:1; 1 Kings 18:44-46).
The hand of the Lord (see Ezek. 1:3).
A deep sleep from the Lord (see Job 33:14-16; Dan. 8:18).
Out-of-Body Experience
He stretched out the form of a hand and caught me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem (Ezekiel 8:3a).

An out-of-body experience is the actual projecting forth of a person’s spirit from his or her body. When God inspires such an experience, He puts a special faith, anointing, and protection around the person’s spirit so that that person can perform in the arena where the Lord is leading.

In an out-of-body experience, a person’s spirit literally leaves his or her physical body and begins to travel in the spiritual dimension by the Spirit of the Lord. Once out there, the surrounding environment appears different than it does naturally because now the spiritual eyes are seeing, not the natural eyes. The Lord directs the eyes to see what He wants them to see in exactly the way He wants them to see it.

Ezekiel is the prime biblical example of a person who had out-of-body experiences:

“The Spirit lifted me up…” (see Ezek. 3:12-14).
“He…caught me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven…” (see Ezek. 8:1-3).
“The Spirit lifted me up and brought me…” (see Ezek. 11:1-2).
“The hand of the Lord was upon me, and He brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and set me down in the middle of the valley…” (see Ezek. 37:1-4).
“And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court” (see Ezek. 43:5-6).
Paul also apparently had an out-of-body experience. Most scholars believe Paul was referring to himself when he wrote:

I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven. And I know how such a man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows—was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which a man is not permitted to speak (2 Corinthians 12:2-4).

Look at the way Paul speaks of this holy, wonderful realm. He does not make a big deal out of it. Whether he was in or out of his body is not the issue. The issue is what he heard and learned while in the experience. What was the message, and what was its fruit?

As with the trance, this is a visionary experience that we must approach very carefully because of its occultic associations in the minds of many people. Counterfeits of all true Holy Spirit-inspired experiences do exist. Outwardly, there may seem to be little difference, but internally, the difference is great both in fruit and purpose. We are never to will ourselves into such an experience! This type of experience is only to be God-induced and God-initiated!

This is not self-projection or some rendition of astral projection. It is not “willing” to project us forth; that is of the occult and witchcraft. God, by His initiative and through the Holy Spirit, can, if He desires, lift us up into a spiritual realm, but we are not to project ourselves forth into anything.

When spiritists, sorcerers, and yogis practice this without the Holy Spirit and seem to prosper by it, it is because they are not a threat to satan. They are already deceived. Whether they realize it or not, they are already in league with him and are not his enemies.

Do not let the enemy steal what God has ordained. Do not be afraid of these unusual ways of the Holy Spirit, and yet do not enter into some type of self-induced activity.

Translation
When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch no longer saw him, but went on his way rejoicing (Acts 8:39).

Translation (supernatural transportation or translocation) is more properly defined as an actual physical experience and not just a vision. But when this unusual experience does occur, the individual could be shown various things of the supernatural visionary sort as he or she is being transported. Out of all of these levels of activity mentioned, I have not yet experienced this one. I have friends who have incredible stories of such events. As for me, I am asking the Lord that I might experience all that He has available for me and desires for my life.

Here are a few biblical examples:

After Jesus was tempted by the devil in the wilderness, He was transported to another place (see Matt. 4:3-5).
Philip the evangelist was translated after he shared the Gospel with the Ethiopian eunuch (see Acts 8:39).
Peter was translated out of prison, but while it was happening, he did not realize it. As far as he was concerned, he was having a vision or a dream. Although there is no way to know for sure, this could have been some form of a translation (see Acts 12:8-9).
Heavenly Visitation
I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven (2 Corinthians 12:2).

The Bible refers to three heavens:

The lowest heaven, the atmospheric sky that encircles the earth (see Matt. 16:1-3).
The second heaven, the stellar heaven that is called outer space, where the sun, moon, stars, and planets reside (see Gen. 1:16-17).
The third Heaven, which is the highest one, and the center around which all realms revolve, is Paradise, the abode of God and His angels and saints (see Ps. 11:4; Neh. 9:6).
A heavenly visitation is like an out-of-body experience, except that the person’s spirit leaves the earth realm, passes through the second heaven, and goes to the third Heaven. This can occur while the person is praying, while in a trance or a deep sleep from the Lord, or at death.

Some biblical examples include:

Moses. During his 40 days of fasting on Mount Sinai, Moses “saw” the tabernacle in Heaven and was given the “blueprint” for building an earthly version. This may possibly have been a heavenly visitation; we cannot tell for sure. At the very least, it was an open Heaven experience (see Exod. 24:18; 25:1,8-9; Heb. 8:5).
Paul. Again, the apostle was “caught up to the third heaven,” where he heard unspeakable words and had a truly paradisiacal experience. Paul seems to have immediately been caught up into this realm (see 2 Cor. 12:2-4).
Enoch. According to Genesis, Enoch “walked with God” and God took him. He was caught up into Heaven without dying and never returned to earth (see Heb. 11:5).
In the same way that people can visit the third Heaven by having out-of-body experiences, they can also visit the various regions of hell. If they are sinners, they approach hell by descending—in death or a near-death experience or in a supernatural vision—and are shown where they are destined to spend eternity unless they repent and accept Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior. Then they are brought back to earth into their bodies by the mercy of God.

If people are Christians, the Spirit of the Lord may bring them to hell in such an experience as well, for the purpose of revealing the suffering torments of the damned. They are then sent back to their bodies to testify and warn non-Christians to repent and to receive Jesus as Lord. These experiences are also used as tools of encouragement to the Body of Christ that the unseen world is real. God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him (see Heb. 11:6). Heaven and hell are real! Every person is an eternal being, and the final destination is what matters!

I believe heavenly visitations have occurred not only in the Bible but also throughout history. Such experiences will increase as true apostolic ministry emerges in these last days. Join me and express your desire that you might step into all that our Father God has prepared for you.
