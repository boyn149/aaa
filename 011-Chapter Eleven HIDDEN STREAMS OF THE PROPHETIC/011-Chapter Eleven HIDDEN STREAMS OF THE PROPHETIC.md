# HIDDEN STREAMS OF THE PROPHETIC 

In my own experience, I have found that the most direct road to greater intimacy with God has come through the practice or discipline of an almost lost art in the fast-paced Church of today—something called contemplative prayer. Since discovering it well over a decade ago, it has become one of my loves—one of the central features of my walk with God.

But you ask, “What does this have to do with cultivating the seer dimension?” For starters, let me give you one thought that I will develop in this chapter: Prayer brings us into His presence, and in His presence is the spirit of revelation.

One night in 1991, I had a dream that I did not understand (which is not at all unusual for me). A voice from the Lord said to me, “I will reveal to you the hidden streams of the prophetic.”

At the time, a young couple was living with Michal and me. Marcus and Alyxius Young were preparing to be sent forth as fourth-generation missionaries to Southeast Asia. Because Marcus grew up on the mission field of the Philippines, his Christian walk was very different from that of most North American believers. Today their ministry, Divine Inheritance, is rescuing child soldiers in various countries and leading the way in the current-day global justice movement. But Marcus then was largely self-taught, reading basically only the Bible and the writings of the early Christian Church fathers. His literary expertise did not include modern-day Christian writing, charismatic or otherwise.

As I pondered my dream, I thought of Paul Cain, a senior seer statesman at the time, who had re-emerged after almost 25 years of being hidden. Knowing his pilgrimage, I speculated that the words spoken in my dream—“I will reveal to you the hidden streams of the prophetic”—might mean that there were others who were still in hiding. I felt that the Lord was going to bring these hidden vessels out of the closet and reveal them. I was thrilled with the idea that the Lord might allow my path to cross those of others, so that we could cross-pollinate and learn from one another.

When I shared with Marcus my dream and my interpretation of its meaning, he said, “No, that’s not what your dream is about. The Lord is going to reveal to you the hidden streams of the prophetic through the desert fathers and the Christian mystics.”

When I heard that, my heart leapt inside of me, and I said, “Oh Lord, yes.” I have always loved Church history, even though I do not have degrees to show for it. By the Lord’s supernatural help, I have often bumped into revelations of significant proportions almost accidentally.

On another similar occasion, I was lying on the floor having some “carpet time” after Mahesh Chavda had prayed for me. As I lay there, I saw a picture of a “kegger,” a small round wooden keg. Looking at this in the spirit, I thought, “This can’t be from God.” Then as I continued looking, I saw that the keg was under the neck of a large dog—a Saint Bernard, in fact. As I continued to watch in this interactive vision, this big dog came up and stared me in the face. “What is this?” I wondered. Just then words entered my mind: “I am going to introduce you to the life of St. Bernard of Clairvaux.” I had never heard of him. Only later did I learn that he was a twelfth-century monk who was quite familiar with the ways of contemplative prayer and walking in greater intimacy with God.

These experiences set me on a year-long journey into some of the richest treasures in Christianity, a journey that I would encourage any believer to take. For one full year (I would have loved to do it longer) I read only from the Bible and the writings of the earliest Christian leaders, commonly known as the “desert fathers.” I am forever spiritually richer because of this journey. I have since learned a lot and even written the book The Lost Art of Practicing His Presence which, incorporates the revelation the Holy Spirit taught me in those formative years.

The Way of Contemplative Prayer
During that year, the more I read, the more I realized I was on familiar ground. This was a road I was already walking on to some extent. Contemplative prayer was all about the quest for intimacy with God. The Bible is full of references to this quest:

But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit (2 Corinthians 3:18).

Cease striving and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth (Psalms 46:10).

Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God (Hebrews 12:2).

We are talking about an ancient Christian practice that has not been widely known or practiced in much of the evangelical and charismatic ranks today, but which the Spirit of God is restoring to the broader Body of Christ.

In contemplative prayer, we as Christians do not primarily relate to God as the One who sits upon His throne in Heaven but, through the reality of our new birth in Christ, connect with Him as the One who has taken up residence inside us. We each have a throne in our hearts where He dwells in a very personal way. In contrast, in intercessory prayer, we approach God who is seated on His throne in Heaven. We then, as priestly believers, make our appeal, stand in the gap, and remind God of His Word.

Another phrase that is often used in many circles today is “communion with God.” This is commonly understood to mean coming into fellowship with God through the power of the Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ, who dwells in the born-again believer. Communion with God is a way of fellowshipping with the Holy Spirit by learning to quiet the distractions of our soul and of the world, calming the inner chaos and noise from outside that tends to vie so strongly for our attention. In this wonderful form of prayer, we come, as it were, into the heart, or “center” of our being, where God dwells through the Holy Spirit, who has taken up residence there. We behold the beauty of the Lord and inquire in His temple (see Ps. 27:4).

In the first chapter of Colossians, Paul speaks of the saints “to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory” (Col. 1:27). The “hope of glory” is Christ in us. Some of the earlier Christian contemplatives and mystics, such as Madame Guyon and others, refer to this as “greater union with Christ.” Let’s look briefly at a quote about Jeanne Guyon as penned in my dear wife’s book, A Call to the Secret Place.

Most profoundly of all, Madame Guyon’s life teaches us this wonderful truth about how we can experience intimacy with God. For she writes: “It is Jesus Christ Himself, the real and essential Word, who is in the center of the soul that is disposed for receiving Him. Never one moment ceases from His living fruitful, and divine operation.”1

As we come into communion with God, who dwells inside of us, we come into fellowship with the zoe, the very life of God, which cleanses us and sets us apart for Him. That is what it means to be transformed.

Long ago I learned a statement that gives a simple explanation to all of this: We must maintain the inner life to be effective in the outer life. In order to be able to step out in confidence and authority to do God’s will and minister in the power of the Spirit, we must nurture and maintain our inner communion and fellowship with God. We must regularly go to that abiding place in our hearts where His presence dwells.

Too often throughout Church history and even today, Christians tend to be divided into two camps over these truths. One camp is the “going and doing” camp, always going, always busy at the work, doing missions, serving the poor, and preaching the Gospel. The other camp is the “contemplative” camp, the meditative, quiet, and reflective ones who so love the “interior castle” that they just want to dwell there and stay there all the time.

Bernard of Clairvaux, the twelfth-century monk and mystic, identified three “vocations” in the Christian life: that of Lazarus, the penitent; that of Martha, the active and devoted servant of the household; and that of Mary, the contemplative. According to Jesus, Mary had chosen the best part. There was no reason for her to envy Martha or to leave her contemplation, unasked, to share in Martha’s labors. Contemplation should always be desired and preferred. Activity should be accepted, though never sought for its own sake. In the end, the completion of the Christian life is found in the union of Martha, Mary and Lazarus in one person.

The inner life prepares us for the outer life; both are necessary. One of the lessons we must learn is to build a bridge between the two.

Listen, Watch, Wait
This type of communal prayer is not as much doing something as much as it is being with Someone, continuing in prayer with this Someone until we become the expression of Him in the world around us. One of the best things I have done in recent years happened in Spokane, Washington, when I participated in five days of the “vow of silence.” For the first ten hours of each day, seven of us would meet together in the mornings just to share, and then we would take a vow of silence for the next ten or 12 hours. This meant no talking at all, not to ourselves or to any other person. What a spiritual discipline! What a hard day, but oh, how enriching!

That week really revved my engine! By the fourth and fifth days, I was being flooded with revelation that kept me fueled for months. This was nothing other than the spiritual discipline of quieting my soul before God, preparing myself to listen, and waiting to hear His voice. I can hardly describe the deep sense of inner peace and contentment that came upon me during that time.

The eighth chapter of Proverbs provides three important principles related to contemplative prayer:

Now therefore, O sons, listen to me, for blessed are they who keep my ways. Heed instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it. Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at my doorposts. For he who finds me finds life and obtains favor from the Lord. But he who sins against me injures himself; all those who hate me love death (Proverbs 8:32-36).

Verse 34 contains the three principles: listens, watching, and waiting. All three of these verbs are in the continuous passive tense in the Hebrew, meaning they are ongoing rather than momentary. Blessed are those who listen and keep on listening, who watch and keep on watching, and who wait and keep on waiting.

In order to listen, we have to shut our mouths. We cannot speak and hear at the same time. Watching at the gates means staying alert and wakeful. Joshua, Moses’ servant and successor, faithfully stationed himself outside the tent of meeting every time Moses went in. Because he was watchful, Joshua was the first to see the glory that was on Moses’ face when he came out after meeting with God. Waiting at the doorposts means standing by to hear what the Lord will speak, ready to do His bidding or to sit still in reverence and worship, whichever He desires of us.

What are the keys to contemplative experience? Listen, watch, and wait.

The Vocabulary of the Contemplative
Contemplative prayer is not a technique. It is not a relaxation therapy exercise or a form of self-hypnosis. It is not a paranormal or psychic phenomenon. Neither is it a New Age approach to self-improvement nor an attempt to empty one’s mind. It is not a new thing or a remake of Eastern meditation dressed in “Christian clothing.” Contemplation is an age-old biblical tool for coming into fellowship with God.

To contemplate means to gaze at intently, to think about intently, to study, to expect or to intend, to meditate, to muse. The word muse means to think about or to consider deeply, to meditate. To meditate means to plan, intend, to think deeply, to reflect upon. The word reflect means to throw back light, heat, or sound, to give back an image as in a mirror, to bring back or come back as a consequence or as reflected glory.

Any concept is confusing if we do not understand the terms or the vocabulary being used. For this reason, I want to define some of the terms commonly found in prophetic, contemplative Christian writings, both old and new.

False self. This is the old sinful nature or “old self” that Paul talks about in Ephesians:
In reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth (Ephesians 4:22-24).
This “false self” is the ego-centered self that holds onto the things and values of the world and trusts in possessions, power, or other people in trying to find happiness, fulfillment, peace, purpose, meaning, and life.

True self. This corresponds to the new spiritual nature we have as Christians, the “new self” of Ephesians 4:24 and Colossians 3:10:
Do not lie to one another, since you laid aside the old self with its evil practices, and have put on the new self who is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created him (Colossians 3:9-10).
Centering. Although used extensively by the Quakers, this term is not exclusive to Quaker theology and practice. It means simply to let go of all competing distractions until we are truly present with Him. I love that. Centering is the meditative art of quieting ourselves and focusing on the Lord, who is the center of all life.
Recollection (re-collection). This is the process of bringing together disparate parts into a unified whole. It is allowing the Holy Spirit to cast light upon the fragmentations of our lives so as to bring cleansing and healing into our souls, our emotions, our remembrances, and our thoughts. A more familiar term that means the same thing is integration.
Union with God. This means to be made one with our Master and our Creator God. It is a work that God does in our hearts, with two vital preparations on our part: love for God and purity of heart. First comes the revelation of God’s vast love toward us; and second, this allows Him to produce in us a heart of purity as an expression of our love for Him.
Spiritual ecstasy. This is essentially the same as what we saw in Chapter Nine on the ecstatic dimension: a supernatural trance state initiated by the Holy Spirit where one is caught up into the realm of the Spirit so as to receive those things—revelations, visions, or other experiences—that God desires.
All of these reflect an attempt by contemplative believers to describe the indescribable. In the end, we are reduced to the simple confession of Walter Hilton: “Contemplation is love on fire with devotion.”

Contemplative prayer is an exercise in letting go of the control of our own lives and no longer leaning on the props of the false self. It is a kind of communion intended to increase our intimacy with God and our awareness of His presence. It is a step of submission, where we place our being at God’s disposal, as we request His work of purification. In Christ Jesus, we open ourselves up to the Holy Spirit to get in touch with the new person, the true self, and to facilitate an abiding state of union with God.

Recollection
Richard Foster, a Quaker and author of the modern-day Christian classics Celebration of Discipline: The Path to Spiritual Growth, and Prayer: Finding the Heart’s True Home, is a long-time student of various forms of prayer. Through his studies and experience, he has encapsulated contemplative prayer into three stages: recollection, the prayer of quiet, and spiritual ecstasy.2

Phase one is recollection, which, as we saw above, means letting go of all competing distractions. That is the idea behind Psalms 46:10: “Cease striving and know that I am God….” Some translations literally say it this way: “Relax and let go, and know that I am God….”

There is a correlation here between the inner knowing, in a revelatory way, of God’s great love for us, and repentance on our part. Repentance means to turn away from sin and turn to God. In recollection, it means turning away from all competing distractions in order to focus on the Lord and His presence.

One example of a “competing distraction” is focusing on what has already happened, particularly when it causes us to dwell on our guilt and woundedness. As we continue in this journey, truth begins to become illuminated inside of us. One of the first things we will see is the depth of our own sinfulness—all of our failures, hurts, and wounds. Part of the recollection phase is learning to offer these things up as an act of faith and worship to the Lord and then dwelling in the simple reality of faith in the blood of Jesus and the healing process of the Cross in our lives. This process gets into the issue of casting all our anxieties, cares, worries, fears, and tensions upon Him, because He cares for us (see 1 Pet. 5:7).

While resting in quietness, we ask the Holy Spirit to make Jesus real to us and to close off everything else. Richard Foster teaches us that one way to help do this is to see Jesus sitting in a chair across from us. He truly is present, but sometimes we need help to visualize that reality. God created our imagination, and, like every other faculty we possess, we need to sanctify it, surrender it, and use it for God’s purposes.

Our ability to flow in the gift of the working of miracles, including creative miracles, comes in part from our surrendering to the Lord this creative part of our lives, our imagination, because that is where we begin to believe the impossible. Utilizing our imagination in contemplation is perfectly appropriate and one of the best uses to which we can put it when we ask God to sanctify and fill our senses with His Spirit. This is not the same as New Age imaging, but simply what Brother Lawrence called “the practice of the presence of God.”

If frustrations and distractions start to press in on us, we need a strategy for shutting them out. Madame Jeanne Guyon, the French Christian mystic of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, and a true pioneer of contemplative prayer whose writings we quoted from earlier, recommended meditation upon the Scriptures for this purpose. When competing distractions vie for our attention, she would tell us to muse, meditate, ponder, and mutter upon the Scriptures. (All of those words are contained in the meaning of the word meditate.) Meditating on the Scriptures helps us refocus our attention on the Lord, which is what it is supposed to do. As Madame Guyon writes in Experiencing the Depths of Jesus Christ:

First, read a passage of Scripture. Once you sense the Lord’s presence, the content of what you have read is no longer important. The Scripture has served its purpose: it has quieted your mind and brought you to Him.

The goal is to become quiet before the Lord, peaceful and still, and allow the silence to still our noisy hearts. This is a skill that does not come easily or quickly, but develops over a process of time. Being aware of the problem is itself a step in the right direction. Recognizing our inability to conquer these distractions on our own is a major stride forward. All of this is part of the process of recollection.

The Prayer of Quiet
As we grow accustomed to the unifying grace of recollection, we are ushered into the second phase of contemplative prayer, what St. Theresa of Avila and many others called “the center of quiet” or the prayer of quiet.

Through recollection, we have put away all obstacles of the heart, all distractions of the mind, and all vacillations of the will. Divine graces of love and adoration wash over us like ocean waves, and at the center of our beings we are hushed, and there is a stillness, to be sure, but it is a listening stillness. Something deep inside of us has been awakened and brought to attention, and our spirits now are on tiptoe, alert, and listening. Then out comes an inward steady gaze of the heart, sometimes called “beholding the Lord.”

Now we bask in the warmth of His dear embrace. As we wait before God, He graciously gives us a teachable spirit. Our goal, of course, is to bring this contentment into everyday expressions of life, but this does not normally come quickly to us. However, as we experience more and more of the inward attentiveness to His divine whisper, we will begin to carry His presence throughout our days. Just as smoke is absorbed into our clothing and we carry its smell with us, so the aroma of God’s presence is seeping into our beings, and we will likewise become carriers of His gracious fragrance wherever we go. That is one of the benefits of communal prayer: basking in the presence of this brilliant One. Then, when we have been in with Him, we go out into the world, and we carry the brilliance of His great presence.

Spiritual Ecstasy
The third phase of contemplative prayer is spiritual ecstasy. We looked at several aspects of this “state” in Chapter Nine. Anyone who has ever been around prophetic seer-type people knows that they tend to be quiet in nature. They calm themselves, many times even closing their eyes, and wait in an almost passive repose. In that place of quiet detachment from the reality around them, illumination—the spirit of revelation—is granted, and their beings become filled with God’s pictures, God’s thoughts, and God’s heart.

This is the way it works with me. I apply the blood of Christ to my life, and I quiet my external being. Then I enter into worship of my dear Lord and bask in the beauty of His great presence. Then He takes me into rooms permeated with the light of His love and fills my being with visions that He desires me to see. At times, I am so captured by His love that He leads me up higher into a heavenly place where my spirit seems to soar. Oh, how marvelous are His dwelling places! Oh, how awesome is our Lord!

Spiritual ecstasy, this final step into contemplative prayer, is not an activity or undertaking that we do, but a work that God does in us. Ecstasy is contemplative prayer taken to the nth degree. Even the recognized authorities in the contemplative prayer life acknowledge that it is generally a fleeting experience rather than a staple diet.

Of this ecstatic state, Theodore Brakel, a Dutch pietist in the seventeenth-century, wrote:

I was transported into such a state of joy that my thoughts were so drawn upward that seeing God with the eyes of my soul, I felt God’s being at the same time. I was filled with joy, and peace, and sweetness that I cannot express it.

Another way to describe this ecstatic state is to be “inebriated” with God’s presence. To an outside observer, someone caught up into the realm of the Spirit and taken to a rapturous place may appear drunk. The essence of this experience is to be overwhelmed with God’s presence, whether or not we see any pictures or hear any words.

St. Augustine of Hippo, the fourth-century doctor of the Latin Church, turned his back on God during his early adult years. His mother, Monica, who herself became known as Santa Monica, prayed faithfully and earnestly for many years for her son, until he finally came into the Kingdom of God. Together they had an experience on the Tiber River in the city of Ostia. Augustine describes the experience in his Confessions:

So we were alone and talking together and very sweet our talk was…discussing between ourselves and in the presence of Truth…what the eternal life of the saints could be like….Yet with the mouth of our heart we panted for the heavenly streams of your fountain, the fountain of life. Then with our affections burning still more strongly toward the Selfsame, we raised ourselves higher and step by step passed over all material things, even the heaven itself, from which sun, and moon, and stars shined down upon the earth. And still we went upward, meditating, and speaking, and looking with wonder at your works. And we came to our own souls, and we went beyond our souls to reach that region of never failing plenty where thou feedest Israel forever with the food of truth. And, as we talked, yearning toward this Wisdom, we did, with the whole strength of our hearts’ impulse, just lightly come into touch with her, and we sighed, and we left bound there the first fruits of the Spirit, and we returned to the sound of our voices, where a word was both beginning and end.

Part of the problem many people have with these hidden streams of the prophetic and other mystical experiences is that those who write about it—those contemplatives who have experienced it for themselves—cannot help but use the language of divine romance and poetic hyperbole, and that makes some folks nervous. Often, the language of the heart makes no sense to the mind except for those whose hearts are involved, because the heart lives in the language of love. The Old Testament Book Song of Songs is our biblical example of this type of message and inspired, poetic vocabulary.

The Goal of Our Journey
Once we get to know these ways of Christ in us—the glory of God Himself living and dwelling in our beings—and come into union and fellowship with Him who now has taken up residence upon the throne of our lives, we will realize suddenly that we were created for that very thing. Walking in this inward life and light gives us the power to go forth into expressions of doing the works of Christ in the outward.

The glory of God was so brilliant upon Moses that he had to place a veil over his face. In the New Covenant in Christ, under which we live, we have an open invitation from the Lord, before whom the veil is rent—an invitation to look upon His face as long as we desire. The door is always open. Let us go in and gaze on His brilliant face! As we look at our Master, we will be changed from glory, to glory, to glory, to glory!

After all, isn’t He the goal of our passionate pursuit? He is the stream of living water that makes my heart glad! Let us pursue the “hidden streams” of the prophetic and grow in greater intimacy with the lover of our souls. He is the goal of our journey.
